The endometrial samples were collected from infertile women at childbearing age under embryo transplantation at our hospital from January 2016 to June 2017. All women experienced infertility for 1.5 to 9 years because of salpingitis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). A total of 12 women who planned to receive IVF-ET were recruited into this study. The women were assigned into case group (n = 6) or control group (n = 6) according to patients' characteristics or response during previous cycles. IVF for women in both groups were performed as previously described. For women in case group, acupuncture and moxibustion at points of guanyuan, zigong, zusanli, sanyinjiao, shenshu, and ciliao were also performed. The endometrium thickness (EMT) was measured at the maximal distance between each myometrial-endometrial interface by using vaginal ultrasonography in the mid-luteal phase. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Nanjing medical University (No. (2014)204). All women provided written informed consent.
For the case group, women received acupuncture and moxibustion from the first day of two menstrual cycles before entering IVF-ET to the day of IVF-ET once every other day. The procedure was as follows: women rested in a supine position. Needles with length ranging from 25 mm to 40 mm were inserted and mild reinforcing and attenuating techniques were applied after arrival of qi with manipulating of needle for 30s, twirling of needle for 90°, lifting-thrusting rage of 2 mm, and frequency of 60-100 times/min. Needle retention time was 30 minutes at each acupuncture point. During needle retention, the Han's acupoint neurostimulator (HANS, LH202) was connected to the needles with ciliao-ciliao and zigong-zigong. The frequency of HANS was 2/15 Hz and strength was depending on patients' comfort. Moxa-moxibustion was applied to guanyuan and zusanli as follows: the moxa stick was hanged vertically at 2 cm above particular point for 10 min at each point. The moxa stick was raised if the patients cannot tolerate.
Endometrial samples were obtained during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Total RNAs from the endometrial samples of the two groups were extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to measure the quantity and quality of the extracted RNA. The qualified RNA samples with A260/280 > 1.9 were used for cDNA library construction as described previously. Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on HiSeq¢ 2500 (Illuminainc, San Diego, CA, USA) in 150 bp paired-end reads. The raw reads were qualified using Fast-QC(v0.11.7) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) by filtering the empty reads, the adaptor sequences, and the sequences with low quality (> 50% of bases whose Q scores were  10%). The clean data were mapped to human reference genome (GRCh38) using HISAT2. The abundance of gene expression was calculated using fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs, including mRNAs and ncRNAs) in the two groups were screened by DESeq based on the criteria of |log2¡foldchange(FC)| > 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.
The function of the DEGs was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) analyses (http://www.geneontology.org) in three categories: cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was performed to identify the cellular signal pathways that the DEGs involved in. The threshold of significance for GO and KEGG analyses was still defined by FDR < 0.05.
The miRNA candidates that target the DEGs were predicted using miRanda and RNAhybrid. The predicted diameters were set to energy < -30 and score >160 for miRanda prediction and energy < -30 for RNAhybrid prediction. Only the overlapped miRNAs predicted by the two databases were retained for further analysis. Cytoscape V3.6. 0 was used to construct the CeRNA network.
The expression levels of three key differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and three key differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were validated by real-time PCR. Total RNA from endometrial samples was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT kit (Takara, Dalian, China). qRT-PCR was performed with a SYBR-Green PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) via a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of the primers used for the PCR are presented in Table 1. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec, dissociation at 95°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 1 min, and 95°C for 15 sec. The results were analyzed using the 2Ct method with internal control of B2M gene. The qRT-PCR reactions were all repeated three times.
RNA sequence data were analyzed by bioinformatics methods as indicated above. Other data were analyzed by SPSS 21.0 (IBM, Chicago, USA). Differences between two groups were compared by two-tailed Students' t-test and P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
