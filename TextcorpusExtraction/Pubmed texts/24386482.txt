Tonsils were obtained from children undergoing tonsillectomy. Non-malignant lymph nodes (mesenteric, axillary, cervical, submaxillary and mediastinal) were obtained from patients (age range: 225 yrs, median: 14 yrs) with non-specific reactive follicular hyperplasia validated by histo-pathological analysis. Briefly, organs were perfused with RPMI 1640 20% FCS, dissociated on a 100 µm nylon membrane, mononuclear cells were obtained after centrifugation over a gradient of Lymphocyte Preparation Medium (PAA) and washed with cold PBS before staining. AITL samples were obtained from cryopreserved lymph node cell suspensions. Participants and next of kin, caretakers, or guardians on the behalf of the minors/children participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study, which was approved by the Necker Hospital Ethical Committees for human research and were performed according to the European Union guidelines and the declaration of Helsinki.
FITC-labeled anti-CD19 (HIB19), APC-labeled anti-CD38 (HB-7), PE-labeled anti-IgD (IA6-2), FITC-labeled anti-CD69 (FN 50), FITC-labeled anti-CD45RA (5H9), Alexa488-labeled anti-Ki67 (B56), 7AAD (all from BD Biosciences), efluor450-labeled anti-CD3 (OKT3), PE-Cy7-labeled anti-CD4 (RPA-TA), PE or FITC-labeled anti-CD25 (BC96) APC-labeled anti-Foxp3 (236A/E7) (all from eBioscience), FITC-labeled anti-CD57 (HCD57), PERCP-Cy5.5-labeled anti-CXCR5 (TG2/CXCR5), FITC-labeled anti-PD1 (EH12.2H7), Alexa647-labeled anti-ICOS (C398.4A), PERCP-Cy5.5-labeled anti-CCR7 (TG8/CCR7) (all from Biolegend) and PE- or APC-labeled anti-neuropilin1 (anti-BDCA4, 446921, R&D Systems) were used to stain and analyze T cells and B cells populations. Staining was performed as previously described. Data were acquired on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and were analyzed with FlowJo 8.8.2 software (Treestar).
CD4+ T cells were isolated from human tonsils using CD4 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD4+ CD3+ CXCR5- Nrp1- (non-Tfh cells), CXCR5+ Nrp1- and CXCR5+ Nrp1+ subsets were isolated by cell sorting. For suppression assays, 100 x 103 non-Tfh cells labeled with 1 µM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) were activated with 5 µg/ml anti-CD3µ (UCHT1, R&D Systems) and 2.5 µg/ml anti-CD28 (37407, R&D Systems) plate-bound antibodies in the absence or presence of various ratios of Nrp1+ Tfh cells. CD19+ B cell subsets were isolated by cell sorting and were cultured (100 x 103 cells per 200 µl per well) alone or with the previously described T cell subsets (50 x 103 cells per 200 µl per well) in 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plates. All cocultures used autologous T and B cells from the same tonsil, unless otherwise stated. For transwell experiments, 24-well U-bottom tissue culture plates and 0.4 µm BD Falcon cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences) were used. B cell viability was assessed by 7-AAD staining after 5 days of culture and live B cells counted with flow cytometry beads (Accucheck, Invitrogen). IgG, IgA and IgM production in the supernatant were determined after 10-14 days of culture by ELISA according to the manufacturers protocol (Bethyl). For all experiments, culture medium consisted of RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
Gene expression analysis was performed on 250 ng mRNA from ex vivo isolated Nrp1- Tfh and Nrp1+ Tfh cells of 5 distinct tonsils. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). After cDNA synthesis (SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen), qPCR analysis was performed using custom designed qPCR plates (96 target genes, StellARray, Lonza) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara), in StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed with Microsoft Excel as follows: gene expression (relative to ACTB) was calculated from Ct values with the 2Ct(ACTB)-Ct(gene) formula for each sample independently. For every gene, differential expression in Nrp1- and Nrp1+ Tfh cell populations was assessed using a paired students t test. All gene expression data (Ct values, gene expression values, fold change and p-value) are compiled in Table S1 available online. 
Statistical analyses were performed using the appropriate tests, as indicated in the figure legends, using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad) or Microsoft Excel.
