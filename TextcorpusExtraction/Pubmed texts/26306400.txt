The study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the independent Ethics Committees of participating centres and countries.
Patients were required to understand and sign the informed consent form and understand and fill in questionnaires.
To be included in the study, men were required to be between 45 and 85 years old with BPH related LUTS for over 12 months, have an IPSS score ¥12, prostatic volume ¥30cm3 determined by transrectal ultrasound, maximum flow rate (Qmax) 515ml/s for a voided volume 150500ml, and total Prostatespecific antigen (PSA) 4ng/ml or 10ng/ml with ratio PSA (free)/PSA (total) ¥25% or negative prostate biopsy. Patients were required to be free of antiandrogens and LHRH analog for at least 6 months, 5 alphareductase inhibitors and plant extracts for at least 3 months and alpha blockers and alpha/beta blockers for at least 1 month before screening. Patients taking the following oral medications at screening required a washout of 2 weeks: 5PDE inhibitors for BPH treatment, NSAIDs corticosteroids, or antibiotics by systemic route, mepartricine, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta blockers, diuretics, sympathomimetics, antihistamines, antidepressants (anticholinergic), atropine, antispasmodic drugs, antiparkinsonism drugs, pseudoephedrine, chlorpheniramine, or spironolactone (if unstable dose or initiated 6 weeks or less prior to selection). Moreover, these medications were prohibited for the duration of the study.
Patients were excluded if they had a PVR > 200ml (by suprapubic ultrasound), previous urological history including urethral stricture disease and/or bladder neck disease, active, or recent (<3 months) or recurrent urinary tract infection, urinary retention, indication of BPH surgery, stone in bladder, or urethra, acute, or chronic prostatitis, prostate, or bladder cancer, interstitial cystitis, active upper tract stone disease causing symptoms, surgery of the prostate, bladder neck or pelvic region. In addition, any local and/or systemic inflammation disorders, orthostatic hypotension, any neurologic or psychiatric disease/disorder interfering with the detrusor or sphincter muscle, insulindependent diabetes mellitus and noncontrolled noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, history of severe hepatic failure or other severe underlying disease excluded the participation of the patient in the study.
This Phase IV trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01604811) was conducted as an international, prospective, randomised, doubleblind study in 2 parallel groups. After a 2842 day washout period, men suffering from BPHrelated LUTS were randomly assigned to receive daily HESr 320mg (160mg B.I.D hard capsule) or tamsulosin LP 0.4mg capsule and were followed up over 90 days. Four visits were planned for each participant: selection visit, baseline visit (Day 1), first assessment visit (Day 30) and endofstudy visit (Day 90).
Urine samples were collected from the 203 patients treated with HESr (n=102) or tamsulosin (n=101). The first urine stream after digital rectal examination (DRE) was collected at D1, D30, and D90 in preservation tubes (Norgen Biotek Corp., Canada).
RNA extraction and PCR quantification were performed using standard methods. Briefly, 10ml were centrifuged at room temperature for 15min at 1000g. Two millilitre of the supernatant were removed and stored at 80°C for subsequent protein analyses.
Total RNA was isolated from the pellet by using the RNAble reagent and Qiagen RNeasy minipreps according to the manufacturers' instructions (Eurobio and Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The quantity and purity of extracted RNA were assessed with a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech International, Paris, France).
Firststrand cDNA synthesis was performed with 100ng of total RNA and SuperScript VILO¢ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20µl.
Fourteen multiplex preamplification cycles of 2 pools of TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (n=16 for each pool including KLK3 reference gene) was performed using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix Kit (Life Technologies).
The mRNA expression of the 29 most significant BPH inflammation markers was quantified 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Realtime qPCR was performed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Life Technologie) using the following probes:
 ALOX15 Hs00609608_m1, ALOX15B Hs00153988_m1, ALOX5 Hs01095330_m1, CAT Hs00156308_m1, CCL5 Hs00174575_m1, HIF1A Hs00153153_m1, LTC4S Hs00168529_m1 MIF Hs00236988_g1, NFKB1 Hs00765730_m1, PTGES2 Hs00228159_m1, PTGES3 Hs04187821_g1, PTGS2 Hs00153133_m1, PTPRC Hs04189704_m1, SELP Hs00927900_m1, STAT3 Hs00374280_m1, IL17A Hs00174383_m1, ICOS Hs00359999_m1, CCR7 Hs01013469_m1, IL1B Hs01555410_m1, IL6 Hs00985639_m1, IL8 Hs00174103_m1, IL15 Hs01003716_m1, PLA2G2A Hs00179898_m1, CXCL10 Hs01124251_g1, CCL2 Hs00234140_m1, CD40LG Hs00163934_m1, CTLA4 Hs03044418_m1, FGF2 Hs00266645_m1, CXCL6 Hs00605742_g1 and KLK3 Hs02576345_m1
All qPCR reactions were performed with a QuantStudio¢ 6 Flex System (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) and the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix kit (Life Technologies). The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15sec and 60°C for 1min.
Quantification of KLK3 (PSA gene), specific of prostatic cells, was also performed to confirm that the results of markers reflected only the expression of these markers in prostatic cells. The expression of each inflammation marker was therefore normalised to KLK3. In order to have an overview of inflammation markers expression in prostatic cells, we also quantified these markers in the prostate cell line LnCaP and used it as calibrator at baseline.
Protein levels were measured in urine supernatants with Quantikine ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations (R&D Systems Europe Ltd, Lille, France). Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times.
The main efficacy criterion was the expression level on each mRNA gene at D90. The secondary efficacy criteria were the assessment of IPSS and Quality of life (QoL) at all visits, and sexual function (MSF4), Qmax (uroflowmetry), Post void residual urine volume (PVR) (suprapubic ultrasound) and prostate volume (transrectal ultrasound) at D1, D30, and D90.
A link between mRNA markers/proteins and BPH clinical symptoms on changes from baseline was investigated as well as the analysis of protein expression profile. Safety criteria included adverse events, physical examination and vital signs at each visit.
In the absence of previous information on the markers effect size, a sample size of around 200 patients seemed acceptable to reach the objectives of this exploratory analysis. For the primary criterion, downregulation and upregulation of gene expression were considered to occur when at least a twofold change from baseline was observed. Wilcoxon ranksum tests were used to compare both groups. Next, values were dichotomised as expressed (value>0) and not detected. Values at D30 and D90 were fitted together using a method based on the generalised estimated equations (GEE). Finally, the changes from baseline to D90 were categorised into 4 classes and CochranMantelHaenszel tests based on the rank score were used to compare treatment groups. Protein expression profiles were analysed using the same description in classes and the same test.
To account for multiple testing on RNA markers, we applied a Bonferroni correction, which resulted in an adjusted  level of 0.0033. Pvalues larger than  but less than 0.05 were labelled as nominally significant.
For the secondary efficacy criteria, IPSS score, QoL, MSF4 and Qmax, changes from baseline were fitted using a covariance analysis model adjusted for baseline value and treatment. These were also described with respect to the changes of markers.
