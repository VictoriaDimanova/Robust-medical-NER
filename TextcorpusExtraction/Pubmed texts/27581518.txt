The myeloma cell lines and CD138+ primary plasma cells from myeloma patients were grown and maintained as described. Isolation of CD138+ cells for experiment demanding fresh viable cells and co-culture of CD138+ cells and bone marrow stromal cells were done as previously reported. The project was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (REK 2011/2029) and all patients has given informed consent.
For transient gene expression studies, INA-6 cells were transfected following the instructions for the Nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) using 2,5 g CD4 plasmid, Hs_ EpoR_5 Flexitube siRNA, Hs_EpoR_6 siRNA (SI02780351, SI02780400, Qiagen, MD, USA) or control siRNA (Qiagen). The INA-6 cell line was used in the knockdown studies since it is transfectable and because it had a relatively high level of EPOR expression. After 24 h, transfected cells were isolated using dynaBeads anti-CD4 separation (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Cells were treated with rhEPO (10 U/ml) (sigma E5627, 100,000 U/mg protein) 48 h after transfection.
RNA was isolated and cDNA was made as previously described from primary patient samples and cell lines. TaqMan probes were used to detect the EPOR and EPO expression (Hs00959432_g1 and Hs01071096_g1, respectively, gene expression assays, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The comparative Ct-method was used for quantification with GAPDH (HS99999905_m1) as housekeeping gene on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
EPOR on the surface of myeloma cells was stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-labelled anti-EPO receptor antibody [clone 12 K90] from Life Span Biosciences Inc (LS-C182845), 20 l/ml for 30 min on ice after 20 min preincubation with human Fc receptor binding inhibitor (eBioscience, 50 l/ml). Isotype control mouse IgG1 APC MG105 (Invitrogen) was used. All incubations were performed in PBS/1 % BSA. Flow cytometry was performed using LSR II (Becton Dickinson) with FACS Diva software (Becton Dickinson), and analysed with Cytobank. Gates were set on live cells with forward and side scatter and duplets were excluded.
AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining (Abcam, ab14085) and analysis by flow cytometry was used to assess viability in the primary cells incubated with rhEPO in the presence or absence of anti-EPOR antibodies (Santa Cruz: sc101444, clone MM0031-6G7). The anti-EPOR was preincubated for 30 min together with the primary cells before rhEPO was added. Cell proliferation assay was performed after 48 h incubation with rhEPO using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) according to the manufacturers instructions.
INA-6 was washed 4 in Hanks balanced salt solution, incubated for 4 h in 1 % BSA in RPMI before treatment with 10 U/ml rhEPO for 5 min. Primary samples were seeded in 1 % BSA in RPMI and starved for 4 h before treatment with rhEPO, 10 U/ml, 5 min. Lysates of INA-6 and primary cells were made as previously described. Samples were subjected to electrophoreses and transferred to membranes by blotting. Membranes were then blocked with non-fat dried milk (5 %) in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with Tween-20 (TBS-T) (0.1 %) and incubated with antibody against p-ERK-1/2 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Cell Signalling, 1:1000 and EPOR (sc101444, Santa Cruz, 1:200). For detecting p-JAK-2, membranes were blocked in 5 % BSA in TBS-T and incubated with antibody against p-JAK-2 (rabbit IgG anti p-JAK-2, Cell Signalling, 1:200). All antibodies were incubated up to 72 h at 4 °C. GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:50,000) was used as loading control. Antibody binding was visualized with Odyssey Licor detecting system using L680 anti-rabbit or L800 anti-mouse (1:20 000 in TBS-T).
Cell viability experiments of co-cultures were performed using a ScanR-automated fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Acquired images were analysed using the ScanR Image Analysis software. Image acquisition and analysis of myeloma cell viability was performed as described ].
Gene expression data for newly diagnosed myeloma patients without prior therapy in the total therapy 2 (TT2) and total therapy 3A (TT3A) trials were retrieved from NIH GEO omnibus under accession number GSE2658 and EBI ArrayExpress under the accession number E-TABM-1138. Gene expression data for the relapsed myeloma patients with one to three prior therapies in the APEX phase 3 trial 039 and 040 trials were retrieved from NIH GEO omnibus under accession number GSE9782. There are six probe sets designated to EPOR (19p13.2) on both U133Plus2.0 and U133A microarray platforms. Among them, probe set 209962_at was consensually selected due to compatibility of two types of Affymetrix microarrays and oligo-sequence alignment to EPOR locus. Because the patients enrolled to TT2 and TT3A trials were treated under different regimens, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) optimal cut point for EPOR in each clinical trial was identified with the running log-rank test, respectively, based on overall survival of the cohorts at the time of data collection. Hazard ratios were calculated by the Cox proportional model. All statistical computations were performed using R (version 2.13.2; available from http://www.r-project.org) and Bioconductor (available from http://www.bioconductor.org).
The information of Total Therapy (TT) 2 [NCT00083551 and TT3 [NCT00081939 trials were published at the web site of National Institutes of Health (https://clinicaltrials.gov). The baseline bone marrow aspirates were harvested from the patients at diagnosis of MM according to established procedures at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Bone marrow specimens were processed to obtain CD138+ plasma cells for gene expression profiling. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of UAMS, and informed consents were obtained from all study subjects and kept on record in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
