Blood samples from patients attending Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (Qiagen) and directly stored at 80°C and later used for gene expression analysis. MS diagnosis was established according to McDonald's criteria, and HIV infection was certified at the Microbiology Department at the same hospital. All patients and HCs signed informed consent for which ethical approval was obtained. Patients and HC age, gender and clinical status are presented in Table 1.
Total RNA was purified using the PAXgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase to remove trace amounts of bound DNA. After the wash steps, RNA was extracted in the elution buffer provided with the kit and stored at 80°C. RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using NanoDrop ND-100 (Thermo Scientific). For making cDNA, 0.5 g RNA samples, 2 l Random hexamers and 1 l dNTPs mix (stock solution 10 mM) (all Promega) were mixed, followed by a 5 min incubation at 65°C for first strand cDNA synthesis. A master mix containing RNase inhibitor (Promega, United Kingdom), DTT (0.1 M) and 5X First-Strand Buffer was added, along with Superscript III RT (220 U/l) (all from Invitrogen, United Kingdom). Negative controls replacing the RNA template or the RT with DNase/RNase free H2O were included. Samples were incubated as followed: 5 min at 95°C, 60 min at 50°C, and 25 min at 70°C. cDNA was stored at 80°C.
After titration of different cDNA dilutions, 1:2 DNase/RNase free H2O dilution was selected. Relative quantification was performed using Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS) as housekeeping gene. Nine hundred nanomolar of probe/forward and reverse primer mix of MSRV//HERV-Wenv (designed as reported previously in the literature, TLR4, TLR2, and HMBS (TaqMan, Invitrogen) were used. All samples were run in duplicates. RT- PCR reactions were performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in 96-well plates. The following incubation protocol was imposed: 10 min at 95°C and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95°C followed by 30 s at 60°C. The mean Ct values of MSRV//HERV-Wenv, TLR4 or TLR2 were normalized compared to the Ct value of HMBS. Calculation of the relative amounts of MSRV//HERV-Wenv, TLR4 or TLR2 was performed using the 2Ct method with one HC used as a standard (HC15, selected for the high amount of RNA concentration). The reference sample HC15 was analyzed in all the different plates as an inter-run calibrator. Any change in gene expression between HC, MS and HIV patients compared to HC15 was expressed as a fold change using the formula below:
Fold increase for each patient compared to the HC15 = 2Ct

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood donors using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Surface staining for Pe-Cy7 anti-CD3 (UCHT1), PE anti-CD14 (M5E2), and Pe-Cy5 anti-CD20 (2H7) all from BD was performed on PBMC. HERV-W was detected using primary anti-HERV-WEnv rabbit polyclonal antibody (Allele Biotech) with secondary CF488A goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). A control with only secondary CF488A goat anti-rabbit antibody was included, and Fluorescence minus one (FMO) samples were used to set the gating. Cells were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 4°C. After incubation, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and centrifuged at 300 g for 6 min. Cells were then fixed with 500 l Fixation buffer (2% paraformaldehyde, BD). Blue Live/dead marker (ThermoFisher Scientific) was included in the staining to assess the viability. Cells were analyzed by FC using LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and FlowJo software (version V10, FlowJo, LLC, United States).
CD20+ B cells were purified from PBMC by positive selection using a CD20+ cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's instructions. Collected CD20+ and CD20 cells were counted with haemocytometer. Purity of CD20+ cells was assessed using an anti-CD20 Ab by FC. 106 CD20+ isolated B cells were cultured in 400 l of complete medium [Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units penicillin1 mg/ml streptomycin (pen/strep), 20 mM L-glutamine all from Sigma- Aldrich] with 30 g/ml of CpG OND 2006 (Invivogen, sequence TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GT) in 48-wells plate for 24 h. Activation of CD20+ cells was assessed using an anti-CD86 Ab by FC.
Five to 10  106 of isolated PBMC were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min. Three ml of supernatant from a B95.8 EBV infected marmoset B cell line (kindly donated by Jill Brooks, Birmingham, UK) was collected from the same batch and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min. The B95.8 supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 m filter on the PBMC pellet, and the PBMC mixed with the virus were incubated overnight at 37°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and infected PBMC were re-suspended in complete RPMI + 1 g/ml Cyclosporine A (Sigma). LCL was established from 6 different healthy donors and was expanded in culture.
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors inhibit HIV reverse transcription, and are divided into Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NtRTI), and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI). NRTI and NtRTI act as competitive substrate inhibitors, while NNRTI inhibits reverse transcriptase by binding to an allosteric site of the enzyme. Integrase inhibitors (II) inhibit the viral enzyme integrase, and protease inhibitors block the viral protease enzyme. Drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in DMSO. One million LCL from different donors were treated with Lamivudine (NRTI), Tenofovir (NtRTI), Daranuvir (PI), Efavirenz (NNRTI) and Raltegravir (II) at concentrations of 10, 1, and 0.1 M for 5 days. At day 3, the medium was changed, and fresh drugs were added. The range of different doses was chosen based on datasheet indication and previous publications where similar tests in vitro were used to test antiretroviral efficacy against HIV or porcine endogenous retroviruses.
The data were presented as medians and interquartile range, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism v7 as reported in the figure legends.
