Cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 without antibiotics and with routine monitoring for Mycoplasma contamination. HER2+/ER- SKBR3, HER2+/ER- HCC1954, HER2-low/ER+ T47D, and HER2-low/ER+ MCF-7 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were maintained in RPMI 1640 and 10% heat-inactivated (HI) FCS. HER2-low/ER+ CAMA-1 (ATCC) was maintained in MEM, 10% HI FCS, NEAA, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, HER2-low/ER- CAL-51 (German Tissue Repository DSMZ) in DMEM, 10% HI FCS and 2mM sodium pyruvate. Estrogen supplementation was not utilized for ER+/HER2-low cell lines (MCF-7, CAMA-1, T47D), the FCS and phenol red in the culture medium maintained cell growth. Cell lines were authenticated by STR DNA profiling (Source Bio-science). Lapatinib, afatinib and neratinib were obtained from Sequoia Chemicals and solubilized in DMSO. Trastuzumab (Herceptin ) and rituximab (Rituxan ) were obtained from St. Vincents University Hospital. Pertuzumab (Perjeta ) was obtained from Roche Innovation Center, Penzberg, Germany.
The growth inhibitory effects of TKIs, trastuzumab and pertuzumab were measured using an acid phosphatase-based proliferation assay, as previously described. A description can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Protein lysates were prepared from 1 X 106 cells seeded in 90mm petri-dishes 24 hours prior to treatment with TKIs or controls. Cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitor, PMSF and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Protein samples were prepared at the required concentration in 4X loading buffer (Invitrogen). Samples were denatured (95°C for 5 minutes). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). EGFR (CST #4267), HER2 (Lab-vision #OP-15), pHER2 Y1221/1222 (CST #2249), HER3 (CST #4754), pHER3 Y1289 (CST #4791), pHER2 Y1248 (Upstate #06229), pEGFR Y992 (CST #2235) and pEGFR Y1068 (Millipore #07818), MHC Class I (Abcam #ab52922) HLA-E (Abcam #ab2216), PD-L1 Clone E1L3N (CST #13684), Alpha-tubulin (Sigma #T6199) primary antibodies. Mouse (Sigma #A6782) and rabbit (Sigma #A6154) secondary antibodies were used. Protein bands were visualised using luminol detection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or ECL (GE Healthcare). Densitometry was carried out using TotalLab software.
Ethical approval for collection of blood was obtained from St. Vincents University Hospital Ethics Committee. 20 ml. of whole blood was collected from healthy female volunteers in EDTA vacutubes (BD Biosciences). The PBMC fraction was isolated using a Ficoll-Paque plus protocol (GE Healthcare). PBMCs were counted by flow cytometry (Guava Viacount) and re-suspended in ADCC assay medium (RPMI-1640/10% HI FCS/0.1mM penicillin/streptomycin). NK cells were isolated from the PBMC fraction using CD56+ magnetic beads on a midiMACs column according to manufacturers protocol (7090% purity) (Miltenyi Biotec).
The method for flow-cytometry-based ADCC assays in the absence of TKI-pre-treatment has been published previously. For TKI pre-treatment, cells were seeded in T75 flasks to provide 8090% confluency after 72 hours. After 24 hours, medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium, medium containing 2M lapatinib, afatinib or neratinib, or 0.2% DMSO for 48 hours. 2M was chosen as the TKI concentration based on previous studies. Treatments were removed, cells were washed in PBS and painted with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Target cells were removed from the flasks with minimum exposure to trypsin and washed twice in PBS. Target cell and NK cell/PBMC concentrations were normalised to a concentration of 2.5 X 105 cells/ml (Guava Viacount). Target and immune cell aliquots were then prepared in medium alone or medium with 10 g/ml trastuzumab, 10 g/ml pertuzumab or 10 g/ml trastuzumab and 10 g/ml pertuzumab. Cells were then plated in duplicate at a final volume of 200 l in a round bottomed non-tissue culture treated 96 well plate at 3 ratios. Plates were spun at 50g for 3 minutes to start the assay. ADCC assays were started within 6 hours of TKI removal. Following a 12 hour incubation with donor PBMCs, 40 l 7-AAD was added to each well, mixed and allowed to incubate for 10 minutes. Percentage cell death was determined on a Guava Easycyte flow cytometer using InCyte ¢ software (Millipore). % ADCC = (% target cell cytotoxicity mediated by effector cells with antibody) - (% target cell cytotoxicity mediated by effector cells without antibody). % Direct NK cytotoxicity = (target cell cytotoxicity mediated by effector cells without antibody)  (basal target cell death). Controls included target cells alone +/ antibody, effector cells alone, dead cell controls. The CD20-specific ADCC-capable mAb rituximab was utilised as the negative control for ADCC (Supplementary Figure 1). CFSE-painted K562 cells were utilised as the positive control target cells for direct PBMC or NK cell cytotoxicity.
Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data was taken from analyses of LPT109096 [NCT000524303], a phase II randomized clinical trial examining neoadjuvant trastuzumab and/or lapatinib plus chemotherapy (sequential FEC75 (5FU, epirubicin. Cyclophosphamide) and paclitaxel) in women with HER2-overexpressing invasive breast cancer. RPPA analysis of patient samples is detailed in Holmes et al. 2013. Post treatment samples were collected after two weeks of neo-adjuvant trastuzumab, lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment without chemotherapy.
SKBR3 (10,000 cells/well), MCF-7/T47D, (4,000 cells/well), HCC1954 (2,500 cells/well) were seeded in clear-bottomed 96 well plates and dual stained in series using ICD-targeted (CST #2242) and ECD-targeted (Calbiochem #OP39) HER2 antibodies. Plate preparation is outlined in detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled (A27034), and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled (A11032), secondary Abs (Invitrogen) were used, respectively. Nuclear staining required Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen #H1399) at 4M. Hoechst 33342, primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% NGS/PBS. Images were acquired on the IN Cell-1000 Analyser automated imaging platform and analyzed using a Multi-Target Analysis algorithm on InCell Analysis software. HER2 expression was determined by measurement of integrated fluorescence intensity of Inclusions (Area x Intensity) in the various cellular compartments analyzed. Membranous ECD HER2 = ((Membranous/outer cytoplasmic region excluding nuclei)  (Cytoplasmic region excluding nuclei)). Untreated triplicate wells for medium, DMSO and primary and secondary antibody controls were included.
DNA microarray data from TRIO-B07 (NCT00769470), a randomized phase II trial examining neoadjuvant trastuzumab (H) or lapatinib (L) or the combination followed by docetaxel (T) and carboplatin (C) with H and/or L in HER2+ breast cancer, is publicly available through GEO Series accession number GSE130788. Activated NK cell gene signatures (Cibersort) in tumor samples (n=89) were examined pre-and post- two weeks of neo-adjuvant trastuzumab, lapatinib or trastuzumab/lapatinib therapy without TC. Post- treatment samples were also examined by pathological complete response (pCR) to subsequent chemotherapy plus targeted therapy. RNASeq data was obtained from ICORG 1005 (NCT01485926), a phase II neo-adjuvant study assessing TC with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib in HER2+ breast cancer. An NK cell gene signature (MCP-counter) was examined pre- and post- 21 days of therapy for 8 patients. The analysis included TCH (n=4), TCL (n=1) and TCHL (n=3)-treated tumor samples. MCP-counter was the appropriate analysis tool for RNASeq data, while Cibersort was appropriate for a DNA microarray- based dataset. Details of DNA microarray and RNASeq methods are outlined in Supplementary Material and Methods.
Trastuzumab (Dylight 488) and pertuzumab (Dylight 550) were labelled according to the manufacturers protocol (Thermo-Fisher). 488- and 550-labeled rituximab acted as background fluorescence controls (Supplementary Figure 2). Labelled antibody concentrations were determined by Nanodrop (ThermoFisher). Cells were pre-treated with TKIs and controls for 48 hours in the same manner as the ADCC assays. Cells were washed, trypsinised and seeded at 2.5 X 105 cells/ml in ADCC assay medium for each of the TKI/MED/DMSO treatments. T0 samples (corresponding to the Western blot and HCA data timepoint) were exposed to trastuzumab-488 (10 g/ml), pertuzumab-550 (10 g/ml), trastuzumab-488 (10 g/ml)/pertuzumab-550 (10 g/ml) or left untreated. Additional rituximab-488 (10 g/ml) and rituximab-550 (10 g/ml) controls were run on DMSO pre-treated samples. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, washed twice with PBS and re-suspended in ADCC assay medium. 200l of cells were plated in single replicates and stained with 5M 7-AAD. Dead cell controls were prepared by addition of 5l Triton X. Samples were analysed using Guava Easycyte flow cytometer and InCyte software (Millipore). Rituximab controls were used to set dot plot quadrants. Cell number and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were determined using rituximab controls. For T6 analysis, corresponding to the start of ADCC assays, samples were incubated at 37°C for 50 minutes followed by room temperature for 310 minutes, then treated the same as T0 samples.
