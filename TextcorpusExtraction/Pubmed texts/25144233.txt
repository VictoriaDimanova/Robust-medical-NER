Peripheral blood was obtained from study subjects after institutional review board approval from the Ethic Committee of LMU Munich. All patients gave written informed consent. The protocol and the procedures of the study were conducted in conformity with ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Overall, 66 patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB), 41 patients with acute HBV infection (AHB), 5 HBV resolvers (RHB) and 7 healthy individuals were included (Table 1). Participant's age ranges from 18 to 65 years. Number of cases used for immunological T-cell assays are listed in detail in Table 2. Performance of one or more T-cell assays in each study subject was executed according to individual cell numbers. Patients with chronic infection have been seropositive for HBsAg for more than 6 months, anti-HBc and seronegative for HBs antibodies. Successful antiviral treatment with nucleotid/nucleosid analogs was defined as HBV DNA below 2.000 IU/ml. Patients with HCV, HDV and HIV co-infection were excluded. Acute HBV infection was diagnosed by the following criteria: acute onset of hepatitis in previously healthy individuals, along with recent onset of jaundice, exclusion of metabolic or toxic causes, ALT at least 10-fold upper the limit of normal, HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM positive. HBV resolvers are seronegative for HBsAg and seropositive for HBs antibodies.
HLA-DRB1*01-restricted HBV core 6180 (CWGELMTLATWVGVNLEDPA) and Influenza hemagglutinin (PKYVKQNTLKLAT) (purity: >90%) were used (EMC Microcollections).
Thymidine-based proliferation assay was performed as described previously.
The following reagents were used: PD-1FITC, CTLA-4APC, CD4FITC/APC-H7/V500, CD14PerCP, CD19PerCP, CD3PerCP, Via Probe, Monensin, functional grade anti-CTLA-4 (BD Biosciences); CD244FITC, PD-1APC, CD127APC-Cy7, IL-2FITC, IFN-PE, TNF-PE-Cy7, anti-PD-L1/2 and anti-IgG1 isotype control (eBioscience); TIM-3APC (R&D Systems); CCR7FITC, CD57PacificBlue, CD45RAPacificBlue, functional grade anti-TIM-3 (Biolegend). Micro-Beadsanti-PE (Miltenyi). KLRG1AlexaFluor488 (clone: 13F12F2) was generated as described.
HLA-DRB1*01 MHC class II Tetramers (Beckman Coulter) were used as listed: HBV core 60-75PE (LCWGELMTLATWVGVN), Influenza hemagglutininPE (PKYVKQNTLKLAT) and EBV EBNA1PE (TSLYNLRRGTALA). Staining and calculation of Tetramer+ T-cells including enrichment step and CTLA-4 staining were performed as described  . Briefly, lymphocytes were incubated for surface markers after staining for Tetramers. After wash step, cells were incubated with Micro Beads. 90% of cells were applied to MS Columns (Miltenyi). The other 10% were reserved for FACS (pre-enrichment sample). PE-positive cells were eluted from the column (post-enrichment sample) and analyzed by FACS. Tetramer frequencies were determined by dividing the number of Tetramer+CD4+ T-cells after enrichment by the total number of input CD4+ T-cells.
 In vitro expansion was performed with 2106 PBMC from chronically infected subjects. After pre-incubation with anti-PD-L1/2 (1 µg/2 µg/ml), anti-CTLA-4 (50 µg/ml) and anti-TIM-3 (10 µg/ml) for 30 min. at 37°C, cells were stimulated with HBV or Flu peptide (10 µg/ml). At day 7, 20 IU/ml recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) was added. Based on CD4+ T-cell clone stimulation experiments Tetramer staining was performed at day 21 revealing highest expansion rate of virus-specific CD4+ T-cells.
After 21 days of in vitro expansion of 3106 PBMC with HBV core or Flu peptide in the presence or absence of anti-PD-L1/2 and 20 IU/ml rhIL-2, cells were restimulated with antigen (10 µg/ml) in the presence of autologous irradiated (4000 rads) PBMCs (1105/well) and Monensin (2 µM). After 6 hours of incubation, cells were stained with surface markers, fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-IFN-, anti-IL-2 and anti-TNF-. Cells were gated on CD3+CD4+ T-cells.
Data were shown as mean values with SEM (standard error of the mean). GraphPad Prism 6 was used for Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank and Chi2-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Significance of cytokine increase has been determined by calculating the difference between antigenic stimulation and PD-L1/2 blockade. Patients only exceeding pre-determined values (IFN- >0.38; IL-2 >0.07; TNF- >0.2) were classified as cytokine responders upon PD-L1/2 blockade. Unspecific in vitro reaction was excluded by using matched isotype controls in T-cell expansion and ICS assays.
