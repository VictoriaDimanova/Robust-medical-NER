The data, analytic methods, and study materials will be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results. Material will be available from the Department of Neonatology, the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, which is responsible for maintaining availability. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with currently prescribed guidelines under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Zhejiang University and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines (NIH Publication No. 8523, revised 1996).
The randomization was used to assign the rats and cells to groups and the technicians of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), histologic and morphometric measurements, psychology tests, electrophysiology tests, EdU tests, and luciferase tests were blinded.
We established the IUGR rat model and CHPAH rat model in our previous studies.1 Only male offspring were studied to avoid hormonal cycle disturbances. Offspring of nonrestricted mothers were labeled as control rats; offspring of foodrestricted mothers (with a birth weight <5.8 g) were labeled as IUGR rats.1 After 2 weeks under hypoxic conditions, offspring rats (14 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CON), controlhypoxia (CONCH), IUGR, and IUGRhypoxia (IUGRCH). To raise the comparison ability of the results, all the experiments follow the principle of random control and doubleblind.
Resistance PA rings with diameters between 180 and 220 m were dissected from the lungs of rats under the anatomic microscope. Samples were ground with a liquid N2cooled mortar and pestle. Total RNA for microarray analysis was extracted from the PA ring powder using Trizol. Because of the stem loop structures of the miRNA primers, only mature miRNA molecules were amplified into cDNA using fluorescently labeled Taqman probes and primer sets with a 7500HT Fast RealTime PCR device (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Foldchange of RNA species was calculated using the formula 2Ct. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an mRNA reference control. The small RNA U6 was used as a reference control for miRNA quantification.
Total RNA (50 g) was fluorescently labeled at 37°C for 15 minutes and at 25°C for 30 minutes with T4 RNA ligase. Flash Taglabeled samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 3.0 microarrays at 48°C for 16 hours. Microarrays were then washed as previously described and scanned using a Gene Chip Scanner 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).7 Then, quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the identified changes in miRNA.
The analysis of target gene prediction was completed using the TargetScan5. The 3UTR of the KCNA5 gene was screened as the presence of miRNA response elements from TargetScanHuman and miRanda sites.
Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured to reflect the pressure of the PA as described previously.11 systolic blood pressure (SBP; mean artery pressure) and heart rate were measured as described previously.12 
Immunohistochemical staining of smooth muscle actin was performed as reported previously.11 In each artery (n=25/animal), we measured the outer perimeter of each vessel and the medial area occupied by smooth muscle (smooth muscle actin positive). The ratio was calculated to assess vascular dysfunction using Image Pro Plus software 5.0 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).
The protocol for in situ hybridization for miRNA detection was based on a prior report.13 Specifically, 5m sagittal lung sections were probed using a 3fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled miRCURY LNA rnomiR206 detection probe (100 nmol/L; Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). The miRCURY LNA U6 probe was used as a control. Probe (50 nmol/L LNA probe) annealing was performed in hybridization buffer (H7782; SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO) for 16 hours at 62°C. Following serial washes and inactivation of endogenous peroxide activity (3% hydrogen peroxide, 30 minutes at 25°C), immunolabeling was performed with an anti3fluorescein isothiocyanate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at 25°C (1:100; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). For detection, tyramide amplification was performed with the Individual Indirect Tyramide Reagent (PerkinElmer), and positive staining was evident by a green color. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Roche). The miR206 expression was quantified in the vascular wall of 10 to 15 resistance PAs (<100m external diameter) in rats. Data are expressed as arbitrary units.
Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) and intubated orotracheally with PE240 polyethylene tubing during tracheal transillumination. While breathing spontaneously, 25 L (0.5 mg/kg) of AntimiR miR206 inhibitor in Invivofectamine 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) compounds were nebulized to CONAnti206, IUGR Anti206, CONCHAnti206, and IUGRCH Anti206 rats using an intratracheal microspray device placed in the distal endotracheal tube.11 Nebulized Invivofectamine 3.0 reagent with sterile saline was used as a negative control (25 L) in the CON, IUGR, CONCH, and IUGRCH rats. Rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia for 24 hours before return to the hypoxia chamber. Experiments were performed 14 days after nebulization.
PASMCs were obtained from the resistance PAs of 8weekold rats using an enzymatic dissociation method as described previously.14 To compare the expression levels of miR206 in differentiated PASMCs, the freshly isolated differentiated PASMCs were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 15% fetal bovine serum for 3 days and then used for analysis.
To detect cell proliferation, primary PASMCs from the CON and IUGR groups were seeded into 96well plates at 1000 cells/well before transfection of miR206 inhibitor or antimiRTM miRNA InhibitorsNegative Control (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Dilute Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent in OptiMEM Medium (1:15) and Dilute miRNA inhibitor in OptiMEM Medium (1:50) were mixed as 1:1 ratio. The complex was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature and was added to cells (1 pmol miRNA inhibitor per well). Then, 24 hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 mol/L CoCl2 (a classic hypoxia mimetic; SigmaAldrich) for 48 hours. EdU assays (SigmaAldrich) were performed to assess cell proliferation after transfection (0, 24, and 48 hours) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were scanned in a plate reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) at an absorbance of 490 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate.
Dualluciferase reporter experiments were performed in primary cultured PASMCs. PASMCs were cotransfected with the 3UTR region of KCNA5 cloned into pMirTarget vector (0.008 g/L medium, Sangon Biotech,Shanghai, China) containing the sequence of a firefly luciferase as a reporter and a vector contain a Ranilla luciferase as an internal control (0.002 g/L medium, Sangon Biotech). PASMCs placed into a 96well plate at 70% confluence were cotransfected with miR206 mimic or scrambled miRNA as control (both at 10 nmol/L, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 hours, luciferase activity of firefly luciferase (F) and luciferase activity of Ranilla luciferase (R) was measured by a luminometer (Infinite M1000 Pro, Tecan), using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was expressed as R/F and normalized to the scrambled miRgroup.
The smooth muscle layer of resistance PA rings was dissected. Total protein extracts and western blotting were performed as previously reported.15, 16 The membrane proteins were immunoblotted with antibodies to Kv1.5 (APC004; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel).
After transfection and maintenance under hypoxic conditions for 48 hours, the patch clamp assay was performed on isolated PASMCs that had been cultured for 3 days. Wholecell patch clamp recording was performed as previously reported.1 The Kv current was defined as the difference between the wholecell outward current recorded in the 4aminopyridinefree bath solution and the current recorded after superfusing with the same bath solution containing 5 mmol/L 4 aminopyridine. The current density of Kv channels was calculated by dividing the average plateau phase I Kv by the cell capacitance and was compared among all the groups.17 Electrophysiologic data analysis was performed using the Clampfit subroutine of the pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).
Data are presented as meanSEM. The differences in mRNA and microRNA expression (PCR and FISH), protein expression, RVSP, SBP, heart rate, thickness of smooth muscle layer, EdU assays, current density, and membrane capacitance were among groups were analyzed using oneway ANOVA for 2group comparisons and the Tukey's honestly significant difference test as post hoc statistical analysis. All of the above statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS, version 16.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). The heat map and loglog scatter plot were assessed by Rsoftware of significance analysis of microarray. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
