The Human l-cell line, NCI-H716, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in suspension culture in T25 flasks (USA Scientific) containing RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (1% p/s). Forty-eight hours before experiments, cells were differentiated on matrigel-coated 6-well plates (400,000 cells/well) as previously described. On the day of experiments, media was replaced with either PBS-0·5% BSA (2, 4, and 6 h incubations) or  low glucose DMEM (24 h experiments) with, or without test compounds: 1 mM conjugated bile acids [CBAS, mainly conjugated bile acids (35% TCA, 21% GCA, 14% TDCA, 10% GDCA, 2% TCDCA and 2% GCDCA); and a small percentage of unconjugated bile acids (14% CA, 2% DCA and 2% CDCA)] (Satiogen Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), and 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (Sigma). Cells were incubated for 2 h increments for duration of 6 h, with media replacements, or for 24-hour duration. Cell viability was measured prior to experiments. Media and cells (collected in RNase-free PBS) were collected for ELISA and RNA analysis.
The active GLP-1 and FGF19 concentration of media supernatants was determined using commercially available ELISA kits, (EZGLPHS-35 K, EMD Millipore; DF1800, R&D Systems).
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen), reverse transcribed into cDNA using the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technologies), and amplified by real-time quantitative PCR with gene-specific primers (Supplemental Table 1) using SYBR green (Bio-Rad) detection. Gene expression was calculated using the 2-Ct method, and normalized to ACTB expression for each sample.
Single cell suspensions from human colonic biopsies were prepared for cell sorting as described. Cell suspensions were stained with a fixable violet viability dye (1:1000, Life Technologies), followed by fixation and permeabilization using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with an antibody specific for GLP-1 (ab23468, Abcam, 1:200, RRID:AB_470325), followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary (CA-21202, ThermoFisher, 1:600). The viable fractions of GLP-1 positive and GLP-1 negative cells were sorted using a BDFACS Aria. Cell yield, composition, and FACS-plots were further assessed using the FlowJo software (FlowJo).
Human colonic biopsies were fixed in 10% NBF for 6-hours (human), then embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometre sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series, followed by antigen unmasking (Vector Laboratories). Tissue was permeabiliszed with 0·1% Triton X-100, and blocked with foetal bovine serum. FACS-isolated cells were attached to poly-l-lysine coated coverslips. Slides were incubated antibodies specific for GLP-1 (ab23468, Abcam, 1:200, RRID:AB_470325), FXR (PA540755, Invitrogen, 1:100, RRID:AB_2605921), TGR5 (ab72608, Abcam, 1:100, RRID:AB_2112165), or ASBT (sc-27493, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100, RRID:AB_2188364). For immunodetection, appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect respective primary antibodies. A no primary antibody control was used for each antibody combination, where the tissue staining protocol omitted primary antibody incubation, and was only incubated with respective secondary antibodies and DAPI (supplemental figure 1 a-c). Images were taken on a Confocal Microscope (LSM 780 Axio Observer), and analysed with the ZEN software (Zeiss).
Surgical specimens of fresh human colon were obtained from Tissue Bank at Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge, UK) and used for experiments approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Ussing chamber experiments were performed with minor modifications as described previously.
We studied a total of 307 participants with normal weight, overweight and obesity as part of a cohort of 509 people whose gastrointestinal traits have been reported elsewhere. The participants with type 2 diabetes were selected prospectively for the conjugated BA and ursodeoxycholic acid experiments (described below). The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent. All co-authors had access to the study data and had reviewed and approved the final manuscript.
Participants underwent the blood collection at fasting and postprandial after a 300-calories breakfast. Serum was collected for measurement of serum BA by HPLC, FGF19 (described above), and 7 Alphahydroxy4-cholesten-3-one (7aC4) by HPLC-tandem mass-spectrometry. Analysis using ANOVA.
The placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised controlled trial (NCT02871882) included randomisation and blinding. Twelve participants were randomised to each treatment arm, IC-CBAS or placebo, according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule by the study statistician's office and submitted to Mayo Clinic Research Pharmacy. Allocation was concealed. Experimenters were blind to group assignments, and the study blind was retained until all data had been recorded or analysed and locked in a blinded database by the statistician. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent.
We performed a single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose randomised controlled trial of twice daily oral administration of delayed (ileocolonic) release conjugated BAs sodium extract (IC-CBAS, Satiogen Pharmaceuticals) 500 mg or placebo administered for 28 days in patients with obesity and T2D (NCT02871882). The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent.
For complete details refer to supplemental section. Briefly, twelve participants completed a mixed meal tolerance test, gastric emptying by scintigraphy, appetite and satiation visual analogue scale, random stool sample and blood samples were collected at fasting and postprandially at baseline and 28-day of treatment. Participants were instructed to continue on the same diet and exercise routine during the entire therapeutic trial. The IC-CBAS is composed by conjugated bile acids (35% TCA, 21% GCA, 14% TDCA, 10% GDCA, 2% TCDCA and GCDCA each) and a small percentage of unconjugated bile acids (14% CA, 2% DCA and 2% CDCA); packaged in a methacrylated- enteric coating capsule to deliver compounds to the distal ileum and colon. The IC-CBAS dose of 500 mg twice daily was selected based on previously completed single dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies using taurocholic acid via rectal enema.
The study was powered to detect a difference of 3247 mmol//6hr in glucose area above basal (AAB) in 12 participants per group. Data are expressed as mean  SEM unless otherwise stated. The primary endpoint for analysis was area above basal (AAB) for glucose during treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in fasting glucose, weight, AAB/AUC of glucose, insulin, c-peptide, GLP-1, and FGF19, gastric emptying, and faecal BA. The effects of IC-CBAS on each variable were assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models incorporating the corresponding baseline value as a covariate. Parametric (student T-test) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon) analysis was done between the delta (change from baseline) in IC-CBAS compared to placebo. These analyses followed the intent-to-treat (ITT) paradigm, including all subjects randomised.
Similar methodology as described above was done to study the effect of Ileo-colonic Ursodeoxycholic Acid delivery (Actigal 300 mg, Watson Pharmaceutical) (NCT02033876).
