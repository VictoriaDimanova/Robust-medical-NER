The plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 were evaluated in 20 patients with first-recurrence, de novo glioblastoma in a phase 0 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02207010). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Josephs Hospital and Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ), and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patient characteristics (shown as the median and range) include age (59, 2881 years), weight (79, 54127 kg), height (172, 154184 cm), body surface area (1.9, 1.522.43 m2), total bilirubin (0.5, 0.21.7 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (16, 862 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (24, 14133 IU/L), serum albumin (4.0, 2.14.6 mg/dL), and serum creatine (0.8, 0.61.0 mg/dL).
AZD1775 was provided by AstraZeneca (Wilmington, DE) as 100-mg gelatin capsules. Patients were treated with a single oral dose of AZD1775 at the dose of 100 (4 patients), 200 (4 patients), or 400 mg (12 patients) prior to the surgical tumor resection. Patients receiving a dose of 100 or 200 mg had their tumor resection at 8 to 10 hours following dosing. Patients receiving a dose of 400 mg had their tumor resection at 2 to 4, 8 to 10, or 24 to 26 hours after dosing. For patients with the tumor resection scheduled at 2 to 4 hours following dosing, blood samples were collected at before dosing and at 2 to 4 (at the time of tumor resection), 8, and 24 hours after dosing. For patients with the tumor resection scheduled at 8 to 10 hours following dosing, blood samples were collected at before dosing and at 8 to 10 (at the time of tumor resection), 12, and 16 hours after dosing. For the patients with the tumor resection scheduled at 24 to 26 hours following dosing, blood samples were collected at before dosing and at 2, 8, and 24 to 26 hours (at the time of tumor resection) after dosing. The total and unbound concentrations of AZD1775 in plasma and tumor samples were determined using a validated LC/MS-MS method.
To allow IVIVE in the PBPK modeling, human-derived in vitro systems were used to determine AZD1775 drug-specific parameters, including (i) in vitro metabolic intrinsic clearance (CLint) by human liver and intestinal microsomes; (ii) apparent transcellular passive permeability in the apical-to-basolateral (Papp,A-B) and basolateral-to-apical (Papp,B-A) directions across MDCKII cell monolayers; (iii) interactions with efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 using MDCKII cells with overexpression of human ABCB1 or ABCG2 (named MDCKII-ABCB1 and MDCKII-ABCG2 cells); (iv) interactions with major BBB uptake transporters using HEK293 cells with overexpression of human OATP1A2, OATP2B1, or OAT3; and (v) fraction unbound in plasma (fu,p) and fraction unbound in brain tissue (fu,br) using patient plasma and brain tumor specimens. The details for in vitro experiments are presented in Supplementary Methods.
Simcyp Simulator V16 (Simcyp Ltd.) was used for PBPK modeling and simulations. A whole-body PBPK model integrated with a 4Brain model as implemented in the Simcyp Simulator was developed to predict the plasma and brain concentration-time profiles of total and unbound AZD1775. The model structure and assumptions are illustrated in Fig. 1. System-specific parameters were derived based on the existing virtual Caucasian population within the Simcyp Simulator unless stated otherwise. Details on AZD1775 drug-specific parameters for the whole-body PBPK model and 4Brain model are presented in Table 1. In brief, physicochemical parameters were obtained from literature. The oral absorption was predicted using the Simcyp Advanced Dissolution, Absorption, and Metabolism model, where the dissolution rate was estimated using the built-in diffusion layer model and the human intestinal effective permeability was estimated by IVIVE scaling from the passive permeability determined from MDCKII cell monolayer. The drug distribution to all organs/tissues except for brain was perfusion rate limited. The hepatic and intestinal metabolic clearance was estimated by IVIVE scaling of the in vitro metabolic intrinsic clearance determined from human liver and intestinal microsomes, respectively. The renal clearance was assigned based on sensitivity analysis. Drug-dependent parameters for the 4Brain model were derived based on experimentally determined in vitro data on passive permeability and interaction with efflux and uptake transporter, as described below:
The passive permeability-surface area product on the BBB (PSB) was predicted using Equation (Eq.) 1, where Papp,AÂ†B is the apparent permeability determined from MDCKII cell monolayer and SA is the human brain microvasculature surface area (SA; 1525 m2).
The passive permeability-surface area product on the bloodcranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (PSC) was assumed to be half of the PSB. The passive permeability-surface area product on the brainCSF barrier (PSE) was fixed at 300 L/h, assuming a high permeability of this barrier.
In vitro efflux transporter-mediated clearance (CLefflux,vitro) (L/min/mg) was estimated using Eq. 2, where ER is the efflux ratio determined from MDCKII-ABCB1 or -ABCG2 cells, Papp,A-B is the apparent passive permeability (cm/s) determined from MDCKII, SA is the filter surface area (0.143 cm2) in a 96-well transwell, and Procell is the protein amount (mg) of MDCKII-ABCB1 (mean, 0.019 mg/well) or -ABCG2 cells (mean, 0.014 mg/well) in a 96-well transwell.
CLefflux,vitro was scaled to the whole-brain in vivo efflux transporter-mediated clearance (CLefflux,vivo; L/min/mg) by multiplying a relative activity factor (RAF; Eq. 3).
  where abundance in vivo or in vitro represents the ABCB1/ABCG2 transporter protein expression level in brain microvessels (pmol/mg microvessels) or in cellular models (pmol/mg cells), respectively; BMvPGB is the milligrams of brain microvessels per gram brain, and BW is the brain weight (gram). Given an average BMvPGB of 0.244 mg protein/g brain, average brain weight of 1400 g, ABCB1 abundance in vivo of 6.06 pmol/mg and ABCG2 abundance in vivo of 8.14 pmol/mg in human brain microvessels, and ABCB1 abundance in vitro of 7.02 pmol/mg in MDCKII-ABCB1 cells and ABCG2 abundance in vitro of 4.27 pmol/mg in MDCKII-ABCG2 cells (our unpublished data), the RAF was estimated to be 294 for ABCB1 and 651 for ABCG2.
In vivo uptake transporter-mediated clearance (CLuptake,vivo) at the BBB was assigned based on sensitivity analysis. Efflux and uptake transporter-mediated clearance at the bloodCSF barrier was not incorporated in the 4Brain model given the little information available on the transporters at this barrier, and also because the drug disposition in CSF was not the focus of this study.
Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial were performed in an existing virtual Caucasian population following a single oral dose of 400 mg. The PBPK model was verified by comparing the predicted total and unbound plasma and brain concentrationtime profiles with observed data in patients with glioblastoma.
To better understand the sources of the variability in drug brain pharmacokinetics, sensitivity analyses using the developed PBPK model were performed to examine the impact of BBB integrity (as assessed by PSB), transporter activity (as assessed by CLuptake,vivo and CLefflux,vivo), and drug binding to brain tissues (fu,br) on the extent and rate of BBB penetration. The extent of drug BBB penetration is often assessed by the total or unbound drug brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp or Kp,uu), which can be estimated as the brain-to-plasma drug concentration ratio at the steady state (or brain equilibrium) or area under concentrationtime curve (AUC) ratio. Given the notion that unbound drug concentration drives the in vivo pharmacologic effect, the use of Kp,uu as a measure of the extent of brain penetration is more pharmacologically relevant and therefore was used in this study. Analogous to the concept of drug oral absorption, the rate of BBB penetration was assessed by the time (Tmax,br) to achieve the maximum drug brain concentration (Cmax,br).
Comparisons of the cellular uptake of AZD1775 between the cell line overexpressing a particular uptake transporter and its vector control or between the presence and absence of a transporter inhibitor were performed using two-sided independent samples t test. A P value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
