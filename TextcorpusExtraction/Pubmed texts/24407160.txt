Bosutinib, masitinib and midostaurin (PKC412) were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA), ponatinib from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA), piceatannol and pimozide from Sigma Aldrich (San Louis, MO, USA), and dasatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, tozasertib, vorinostat, everolimus (RAD001), erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib from ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Imatinib, nilotinib, and BEZ235 were kindly provided by Dr.E.Buchdunger and Dr.P.W.Manley (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland).

RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria), 3H-thymidine from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), and the Annexin V-FITC Kit from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). Recombinant human (rh) stroma cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1) and rh eotaxin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA), and rh interleukin-5 (IL-5) from BD Bioscience (San Jos©, CA, USA). A specification of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used in this study is shown in Supplementary Table S2.
The FIP1L1-PDGFRA+ cell line EOL-1 was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). To confirm the identity of EOL-1 and the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, cells were analyzed by conventional cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR essentially as described. In these experiments, EOL-1 cells were found to express FIP1L1-PDGFRA and the following karyotype: 50,XY,+4,+6,t(7;9)(q36;q22),+8,+19; this karyotype is largely resembling previously published results. EOL-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FCS and antibiotics at 37°C and 5% CO2. Ba/F3 cells expressing the imatinib-resistant mutants T674I and D842V of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, were generated according to published protocols. Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% FCS.
Primary neoplastic eosinophils were obtained from one patient with FIP1L1-PDGFRA+ CEL (75% eosinophils in differential counts) and one with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM-eo) and eosinophilia (25% eosinophils). In the patient with CEL, the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutant was confirmed by FISH. As assessed by conventional karyotyping, no additional chromosome abnormalities were detected in neoplastic cells in this patient. Non-neoplastic (reactive) eosinophils were obtained from a patient with reactive hypereosinophilia (HER) (15% eosinophils). Eosinophils were enriched from the bone marrow (BM) using Ficoll (CEL, HER) or from the peripheral blood by Dextran sedimentation (ASM-eo). For proliferation experiments, only cells that showed sufficient uptake of 3H-thymidine over 48 hours, were used. All patients gave written informed consent before BM (iliac crest puncture for routine staging) or peripheral blood samples (routine staging) were obtained. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna. Purified eosinophils were washed and examined for cell viability and the percentage of eosinophils by Wright-Giemsa staining.
Ba/F3 cells harbouring PDGFRA mutants were seeded at 3105 cells/ml and cultured in complete medium in the absence or presence of various concentrations of ponatinib, sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, masitinib, nilotinib, midostaurin, and sunitinib (1-1,000 nM) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The numbers of viable cells were determined at 0 and 24 hours of treatment. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and 7AAD staining (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Erembodegem, Belgium). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto Cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems).
To determine growth-inhibitory effects of various drugs, EOL-1 cells (2104 cells/well) or primary eosinophils (1.5105 cells/well) were incubated in control medium or various concentrations of targeted drugs (PDGFR blockers: 0.01-0.1 M, other drugs: up to 10 M) in 96-well culture plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, 0.5 Ci 3H-thymidine was added (37°C, 16 hours). Cells were then harvested on filter membranes (Packard Biosciences, Meriden, CT) in a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard Bioscience). Filters were air-dried, and the bound radioactivity was counted in a -counter (Top-count NXT, Packard Bioscience). All experiments were performed in triplicates.
After incubation with drugs (37°C, 48 hours), the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified on Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospin preparations. Apoptosis was defined according to conventional cytomorphologic criteria. For flow cytometric determination of apoptosis, combined Annexin V/propidium iodide-staining and staining for activated caspase-3 were performed as described. EOL-1 cells were exposed to targeted drugs at various concentrations (PDGFR blockers: 0.005-10 nM; other drugs: up to 10 M) or control medium at 37°C for 48 hours. Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated with Annexin V-FITC (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) in binding-buffer for 15 minutes. Cells were again washed, and propidium iodide (1 g/ml) (Bender MedSystems) was added. For caspase-3 staining, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in methanol as reported. Thereafter, cells were washed and then incubated with a PE-conjugated mAb against active caspase-3 (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes. After washing, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jos©, CA, USA).
EOL-1 cells were incubated with various targeted drugs (100 nM or 1 M) or control medium at 37°C for 4 hours. Ba/F3 cells transformed by FIP1L1-PDGFRA variants were incubated in control medium in the absence (Control) or presence of ponatinib or imatinib (each 1 M) at 37°C for 2 hours. Western blotting was performed as described using antibodies against PDGFRA or phosphorylated (p) PDGFRA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), antibodies against S6 or pS6 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and antibodies against STAT5 or pSTAT5 (tyrosine 694) (BD Bioscience, San Jos©, CA). Antibody-reactivity was made visible by donkey-anti-rabbit IgG or sheep-anti-mouse IgG (both from GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and Lumingen PS-3 detection reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Expression of cell surface antigens on EOL-1 cells was determined by flow cytometry after culture in control medium or medium supplemented with ponatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, masitinib and nilotinib (0.1, 0.5, or 10 nM) for 24 hours. After incubation, cells were washed and subjected to flow cytometry using PE-labeled mAb against CD25, CD63, CXCR4 (CD184), FAS (CD95), and HLA-DR. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) as described. Staining reactions were controlled by isotype-matched antibodies. For staining of cytoplasmic molecules, EOL-1 cells were incubated in various concentrations of ponatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, masitinib and erlotinib (0.01, 0.1, and 1 M) for 4 hours. Cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in methanol (20°C), and then incubated with mAb M89-61 against phosphorylated Akt (serine 473), mAb N7-548 against pS6, mAb 47 against pSTAT5 (tyrosine 694), or mAb C92-605 against activated caspase 3 (30 minutes) before being analyzed.
Migration of EOL-1 cells was determined using a modified Boyden chamber-assay with Transwell polycarbonate membranes (5 m pore size, 0.33 cm2; Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY). The lower chambers were filled with 600 l RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated FCS in the absence (Co) or presence of SDF-1 (1-100 ng/mL), IL-5 (0.5-500 ng/ml), or eotaxin (5-1,000 ng/ml). The upper chambers were loaded with EOL-1 cells (1.5  105 per well) that had been preincubated with control medium or medium containing 10 nM or 100 nM of ponatinib, sorafenib, masitinib, nilotinib, imatinib, or dasatinib. Cells were allowed to migrate into the lower chambers at 37°C for 4 hours. Then, viable migrated cells in the lower chambers were counted by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) and expressed as percent of total cells.
To determine the level of significance in differences in cell growth, apoptosis, and migration, the paired StudentÌs t test was applied. Results were considered to be significantly different, when p<0.05.
