Compound 1 was purified repeatedly from the extract of Epimedium segittatum by column chromatography (CC) and prepared HPLC. The dried leaves (5 kg) of this plant were extracted three times with 85 % (v/v) EtOH under refluxed (40 L each time for 2 h). The combined extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a residue (0.3 kg), which was further partitioned with petroleum ether (PE, boiling point 6090 °C, 4 L), ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 4 L) and n-BuOH (4 L), successively. The EtOAc fraction (38 g) was subjected to a silica gel CC (400 g, 100200 mesh, 60040 mm) eluted with a step gradient of CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O (90:1:0.1, 40:1:0.1, 20:1:0.1, 10:1:0.1, 5:1:0.1, v/v, 3 L each step gradient) to give five sub-fractions (E1-E5, 2.2 g, 3.1 g, 3.8 g, 4.6 g, 8.9 g, respectively). E4 (0.2 g) was then purified by Sephadex LH-20 CC (120024 mm) with MeOH-H2O (2:1 to 1:1, v/v, 1.2 L each gradient) to obtain crude flavonoids (0.12 g). The crude flavonoids were further separated by prepared HPLC (column Kromasil 25010 mm, 5 m, CH3CN-H2O, 23:77, v/v, 1.6 L) and recrystallized with water repeatedly to yield Icariin (83 mg), whose purity quotient was over 98 %.

Animal experiments conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, Eighth edition, 2011) and were approved by the Nanjing Agricultural University Animal Care Committee (No. 20130093, 2013). To ameliorate suffering, animals which were not expected to survive were humanely euthanized. All steps were complied with AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 Edition).
One-day-old cherry valley ducks were purchased from Nanjing Tangquan Poultry Farm (Nanjing, China). Ducks were housed in wire cages (60 cm100 cm) in air conditioned rooms at 37 °C with lights on for 24 h before the study. The temperature was gradually reduced to room temperature and 12-h light/12-h dark phases, which were kept constant for the remainder of the study. Ducks were fed a commercial starter diet provided by the feed factory of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Science (Nanjing, China). Three-day-old cherry valley ducks (n=180) were randomly divided into four groups: 1-treated group, 2-treated group, virus control (VC) group, and a blank control (BC) group (separately reared). Ducklings allocated to the 1, 2 and VC groups were intramuscularly injected with 0.2 mL of DHAV (20LD50) per duckling. Ducklings allocated to the 1 or 2 groups were given aqueous 1 or 2 at the dosage of 31.25 mg/Kg (net concentration) of per duckling, SID, for 3 days starting on the same day as DHAV injection. Before used, 1 was prepared with 3 % ethanol dissolved, and added a co-solvent 0.5 % Tween 80. In order to ensure the consistency of test, we added the equal amount of ethanol and Tween 80 in the drinking in the 2, VC and BC groups. The dissolution characteristic of 2 is instant into the water. Blood samples were taken from five ducklings in each group at the 4thh, the 8thh, and the 54thh after injecting DHAV. Half of each blood sample was treated with heparin for anticoagulation and the remainder was left to coagulate. Number of ducks which had been taken blood samples needed to eliminate (n=15 per group).
Livers were removed from 14-to-16-day-old duck embryos in sterile conditions followed by gallbladder evisceration. The livers were washed three times with D-Hanks. The tissue was minced with eye scissors and washed three times with D-Hanks. Liver tissue was digested with a solution of 0.2 % trypsin at 37 °C for 4 to 6 min. As soon as the trypsin was completely absorbed, the tissue was rinsed three times with D-Hanks and an appropriate amount of DMEM growth medium was added. The seeding cell density was controlled within the range of 0.8106-1.2106 cell/mL, incubated at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2, the growth medium replaced after 24 h. DMEM was removed when the duck embryo hepatocytes grew into monolayer. The duck embryonic hepatocytes monolayer (DEHs) was washed with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS, pH 7.4) once, and left as standby until CMF-PBS was removed again. The DHAV used for challenge experiments and antiviral assays was supplied by the Shandong Institute of Poultry in China and proliferated by inoculating DEHs. The TCID50 of the virus liquid was 1103 by Reed-Muench assay. It was diluted into 5102(50 TCID50) with MM and used for antiviral assays.
The maximum safe concentration of 1 was 250 g/mL tested by preliminary experiment with MTT method while that of 2 was 1250 g/mL. 1 was serially twofold diluted with MM from 250 g/mL to 31.25 g/mL, and 2 from 1250 g/mL to 156.25 g/mL, thus obtaining 4 concentrations each. 70 L DHAV was added to each well of 96-well culture plate containing the DEHs monolayer. Meanwhile, cell control (CC) group and virus control (VC) group were set. The plate was cultured at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2 for 2 h. The virus solution was removed and the monolayer was washed three times with D-Hanks. Subsequently, 70 L dilution of test ingredient was added to test well using 5 wells per concentration. The plate was left at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2. As the VC group showed significantly cytopathic effect (approximately after 72 h), the MTT method was used to determine the DEHs activity. The A570 value and virus inhibitory rate [(Ädrug+virusÄvirus control)/(Äcell controlÄvirus control)100 %] were considered as the indicators of antiviral activity in vitro.
To monitor the blood virus contents in virusemia phases (the 4thh and the 8thh) and stable (the 54thh) phases of the disease, blood samples randomly taken from 5 feathers per group at the 4thh, the 8thh and the 54thh after challenged with virus were collected, treated with heparin anticoagulation and used for testing its virus nucleic acid contents. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR) was employed in the quantitative analysis of DHAV gene expression at the 4thh, the 8thh and the 54thh in vivo.
Mortality was calculated after all the young ducklings ceased to die using the equation: Mortality of each group (%)=Death in each group/effective samples in each group100 %, and the number of ducks providing blood samples needed to be eliminated (15 feathers per group).
400 L DHAV was added into the 24-well culture plate containing a DEHs monolayer, while the CC and VC wells were reserved. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2, and the virus solution removed. The plate was washed 3 times with D-Hanks. Later, 400 L dilution of test drug was added into the test wells, three wells in parallel, as the most effective antiviral concentration. The 24-well culture plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2 and the total RNA was extracted. Real-time PCR was used to analyze the extent of virus replication.
400 L DHAV was added into the 24-well culture plate containing monolayer DEHS, while the CC and VC wells were reserved. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2. The virus solution was removed and the plate was washed 3 times with D-Hanks. 400 L dilution of test drug at the most effective antiviral concentration was then added into the test wells, three wells in parallel. The plate was continuously incubated at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5 % CO2 for 48 h. The supernatant of cells was centrifuged and the sediment was removed. 100 L supernatant and 100 L DEHs (0.8106-1.2106 cells/mL, as the internal reference) were mixed together and the total RNA was extracted. Finally real-time PCR was used to analyze the virus release content.
