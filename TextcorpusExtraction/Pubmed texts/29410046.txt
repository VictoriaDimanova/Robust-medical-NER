Our study design is shown in Figure 1. We selected a cohort from mild-to-moderate childhood asthmatics who were on ICS therapy in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) trial and for which LCL DEX response and genotypes were available. These data were filtered and combined in the REFS framework to identify genes associated with SRE. To guard against false positives, we carried genes forward for functional validation in human airway epithelial cells where we measured the effect of gene knockdown on NFB response to treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) and interleukin-1 beta (IL1).
The Childhood Asthma Management Program was a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of long-term daily ICS treatments at managing asthma symptoms and improving lung function. CAMP enrolled 1,041 children ages 5 to 12 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma over a 23-month period, and followed them for an additional 4 years. Recruitment criteria and study characteristics have been described previously. During the original trial, CAMP participants were randomized into three treatment arms: budesonide (ICS), nedocromil, or placebo. We utilized three major types of data from selected CAMP participants: clinical data (from which we calculated SRE); genotype SNP data; and transcriptomic profiling from LCLs. CAMP participants were selected for the present study cohort as described below.
After the main CAMP trial concluded, subjects were followed for at least yearly observation. CAMP participants were recontacted for additional blood draw roughly 6 years after study conclusion. Of participants randomized to ICS treatment, 161 non-Hispanic white subjects provided blood samples from which CD4+ lymphocytes were isolated. These samples were immortalized and transcriptomically profiled under two treatment conditions: dexamethasone treatment (106 M) and a sham (ethanol) control. After six hours, expression levels were measured using the Illumina HumanRef8 v2 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Bead-level data was stored using BeadStudio (Illumina) and arrays which had low detection thresholds or low dynamic range were marked as failed. Differential and eQTL analysis of this expression set has been previously described, although we used a different QC and filtering process for the present study, as described below.
We used the beadarray package for the R statistical language to read the previously saved bead-level data of passing arrays and to produce QC plots, Log-2 transformed bead-level data, bead-type statistics, bead summary data, and to perform differential expression analysis. We assembled an expression set of DEX and sham arrays, filtered out low quality probes based on the R illuminaHumanv2.db annotation package, and quantile normalized the data. We used the Bioconductor limma package to examine the multidimensional scaling (MDS) clustering of all arrays including replicates. We identified and discarded defective arrays and sample mix-ups. We identified arrays with treatment condition mislabeling and either discarded the array or corrected the label. We created a paired set of arrays by discarding subjects with only one treatment condition and remaining replicates in such a way as to favor array pairs on the same chip or processed on the same day. We batch-corrected this set using the sva package ComBat function and examined the MDS plot of DEX-Sham differential expression. We identified and removed outliers to produce the final set of paired DEX and Sham arrays.
We selected probes for the training set using the intra-class correlation (ICC) method provided by the R beadarrayFilter package. We used a cutoff of 0.5 to select probes for which the between array variability exceeded the within array variability. This package and cutoff value have been demonstrated to produce more powerful analysis of differentially expressed genes on a publicly available Illumina Spike-in expression set. We selected probes separately for the DEX and Sham treatment conditions and, using probes that were informative in both conditions, took the (Log2(DEX)  Log2(sham)) difference to produce the LCL DEX response data for the training set.
In this study we used the Corticosteroid Responsiveness Endophenotype Model previously described. Briefly, it allows the combination of multiple observations of six clinical measures to assess a subjects responsiveness to ICS. This results in one continuous variable that measures the effectiveness of steroid therapy for an individual. A more positive value indicates a stronger response to ICS. SRE has been shown to produce more accurate measurements of ICS response than individual phenotypes in white replication populations of children and adults with mild to moderately severe asthma and, for children, of multiple races. We applied it throughout the four years of the clinical trial portion of CAMP to produce SRE and its 6 components for each subject.
Genome-wide genotyping was previously performed at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM), using Illumina HumanHap 610 bead chips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). After pruning for minor allele frequency (less than 5%) and probability of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (less than 0.1%), and removing discordant probes identified by Illumina, 471,851 SNPs remained genotyped among 581 non-Hispanic white CAMP participants in 551 families with a genotyping rate of .998. We imputed missing genotypes using MaCH.
To identify potentially informative SNPs for REFS modeling, we performed an SRE genome-wide association study (GWAS) within the CAMP Budesonide ICS treatment arm (N=172) using the R GenABLE package. We selected one sibling from each family for inclusion based on which sibling had LCL DEX response data, or randomly if no sibling had response data, excluded subjects with too high autosomal heterozygosity, and excluded markers with <1.5% minor allele frequency. We performed statistical tests for each SNPs association with SRE based on an additive SNP-model using the GenABLE qtscore function. We used the R fdrtool package to filter GWAS results using the Higher Criticism Statistic (function hc.thresh) and a p-value threshold of p < 0.001 to select SNPS for the training set. This was expected to produce a tractable number of SNPs containing mostly GWAS false positives from which the REFS modeling system could select significant predictors.
We selected the cohort of non-Hispanic white CAMP participants from the ICS treatment arm who had 1) computable SRE measures, 2) genotype data, and 3) LCL DEX response.
We modeled the training set using GNS Healthcares REFS (GNS Healthcare, Cambridge, MA) modeling pipeline. This method has been previously described. Briefly, REFS learns directly from data without need for a pre-specified hypothesis, producing an ensemble or set of Bayesian networks (BNs). Because REFS uses the stochastic Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and simulated annealing methods, each network in the ensemble is different. The number of networks to be generated is specified as an input parameter. These networks are generated and converged in parallel to produce a representative sample of all possible Bayesian networks that could have generated the observed data.
We configured REFS to model our training set variables as continuous values and to allow each variable to act as an input to or output from any other variable, with the exception of SNP genotypes which were constrained to act as inputs only. After generation, the ensemble was checked to confirm that the process had converged (Supplemental Figures 7 & 8) and predicted the training data reasonably well.
The REFS ensemble consists of possible network topologies that might have generated the observed data. In order to integrate the predictions of the ensemble and ascertain statistical relevance of individual relationships, as well as to identify functional indirect relationships, it is necessary to perform in silico simulations. Using such simulations, we perturbed all possible input variables and measured the effect on all possible downstream targets.
The stochastic nature of the REFS modeling approach causes variability in results. We performed the REFS modeling step twice, each with an ensemble size of 256 networks, using the same input parameters but different random seeds, to limit dependence of our results on a single stochastic simulation.
We created a secondary interaction network to summarize each REFS ensemble. In this network we included a vertex for every training set variable and a directed edge for every downstream target for which REFS in silico simulation produced a P-value of less than 0.05. This is an empirical p-value computed using a permutation-based procedure. This produced networks potentially containing multiple isolated subgraphs. We stored the REFS statistics characterizing the ensemble and simulation results as edge and vertex attributes. We assembled, manipulated, and plotted the interaction network using the R igraph package. We queried the interaction network to identify SNPs and genes that interact directly or indirectly with SRE. We focused our analysis on the subgraph containing SRE and characterized the size of each interaction network by the size of this SRE subgraph.. We examined the immediate vicinity of SRE by selecting vertices within 3 hops of SRE (using R igraph package ego function) and identifying neighborhoods based on community structure using the igraph cluster_walktrap function to find densely connected subgraphs via random walks. We simplified plots of these neighborhoods by removing neighborhoods not containing a first neighbor gene.
A549/NFB-Luc human lung epithelial cells were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Transfection of target gene small interfering RNA (siRNA) and non-targeting siRNA (ON-TARGETplus pools; GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was performed using DharmaFECT 1 reagent according to the recommended protocol from the manufacturer (GE Dharmacon). The final concentration of siRNA was 25 nM. 72 hours after transfection, cells were washed and switched to F-12 medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS. Cells were treated with 5 nM DEX (Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA) or 5 ng/mL IL1 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in the medium for 16 hours.
Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) agent (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed using Steady-Glo luciferase agent (Promega). Luminescence was measured by using Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Each sample was measured in triplicates. Statistical significance was assessed using a double-sided t-test.
Total RNA was isolated from cells by using QIAshredder and RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was prepared from 50 ng of total RNA by using SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher). qRT-PCR was set up in the presence of 0.5 µM primers by using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed on an StepOne Plus real time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using Ct method. -actin was used as an internal control for data normalization. Each sample was measured in triplicates.
Written informed consent for CAMP participants was obtained at CAMP enrollment by the childs parent or guardian, and again at blood draw for the collection of biological materials for the purpose of genetic and genomic investigation. These studies were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee, the institutional review board for Brigham and Womens Hospital.
