This study was approved by institutional committees associated with the University of Vermont Clinical Research Center (CRC). This study has been registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ as University of Vermont Protocol Record R01DK082803.
This study was conducted as part of a trial designed to examine the effects of dietary PA on whole body and skeletal muscle PA oxidation, as well as on inflammation, as reported here. The actual data on PA oxidation are extensive and will be reported elsewhere, but a general outline of these tracer studies are given below, both to convey the timing of the relevant experimental procedures and because the experimental results related to PA oxidation were included in the principal components analysis (PCA) (see below).
This was a double-masked, cross-over study evaluating two diets, one based on the FA composition of the Western Diet and high in PA (HPA) and one reflecting more the Mediterranean Diet FA composition, low in PA and high in OA (HOA).
Figure 1 depicts the consort diagram for this trial. Healthy, lean or obese, but non-diabetic subjects aged 18 - 40 yrs. were recruited. Exclusion criteria included use of prescription medication except for contraception, regular use of non-prescription medication, regular aerobic exercise training, dyslipidemia, and evidence of type 2 diabetes. We also excluded subjects who were insulin resistant as defined by manifesting a value for the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) > 4.65. Screening for study eligibility included: history and physical, fasting laboratory tests for evidence of metabolic dysfunction, dyslipidemia, and hepatitis or HIV infection. The results in this paper relate to healthy males (n = 8) and females (n =8), aged 22  39 yrs. (average 29.9 yrs.), with a body mass index > 18 < 25 (n = 6 males, n = 5 females) or > 30 (n = 2 males, n = 3 females). In this cohort, there was one South Asian (male), 3 blacks (2 males, one of whom is a native African), and 12 whites. There were 3 Hispanics and 13 non-Hispanics.
After screening to rule out relevant health problems, all subjects ingested a low fat/low-PA, baseline/control diet for 7 d. (Protein, 19.7 % kcal; Carbohydrate, 51.6% kcal; Fat, 28.4% kcal; PA, 5.3% kcal; OA, 15.9% kcal). On the morning of day 8 of the baseline/control diet, in the fasted state, blood and muscle tissue (vastus lateralis) were collected at 0700; a blood sample also was obtained in the fed state, 3 hr. after the meal for measurement of the fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids. Then, the subject participated in a cross-over study of two, 3-wk. experimental diets; energy intake during the study was adjusted, as necessary, to prevent change in body weight. These experimental diets were separated by a one week period on the baseline/control diet. Our dietary model was described in detail previously. One experimental diet was designed to resemble the habitual diet and was high in PA (HPA)(Fat, 40.4% kcal; PA, 16.0% kcal; OA,16.2% kcal); the other experimental diet was low in PA and high in OA (HOA)(Fat, 40.1% kcal; PA, 2.4% kcal; OA, 28.8% kcal). Both of these diets are characterized by a low-glycemic load. We stimulated and monitored compliance with the diets in three ways: written attestation; daily verbal guidance and diet history; monitoring any food returns (usually absent or minimal).
On day 18 of each experimental diet, after an evening meal at 1800 h served in the CRC and an overnight stay in the CRC, we obtained a 20-min measurement of measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2), and CO2 production (VCO2 ) (Vmax SPECTRA 29, Sensor Medics Corp, Yorba Linda, CA). Then, we conducted a euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp as previously described. At approximately 0530, catheters were placed in an antecubital vein for infusion and retrograde in a dorsal hand vein (heated) for blood draws. At 0555, a baseline blood sample was obtained for measurement of glucose enrichment, and at 0600, a primed (3.46 mg/kg), continuous (0.048 mg/kg/min) infusion of [6,6-d2]-glucose was started and maintained for 240 min. Blood was collected for glucose enrichment at 90, 100, 110, and 120 min after beginning the glucose tracer infusion and at 100, 110, and 120 min for glucose concentration. At 120 min, we initiated an insulin infusion (40 mU/ m2/ min )(278 pmol/ m2/ min) as well as a variable rate infusion of 20% dextrose with the goal of obtaining a steady-state plasma glucose level of 80 - 90 mg/dL. [6,6-2H2] was added to the 20% dextrose infusate prior to the study to preserve steady-state plasma enrichments. Plasma glucose levels were monitored every 5 minutes (or more often) during the clamp, and the dextrose infusion rate was adjusted to achieve the euglycemic target. Serum insulin was monitored at 0 minutes prior to the insulin infusion and at 30 min intervals during the clamp. Glucose enrichment was again monitored at 150, 180, 210, 220, 230, and 240 min after beginning the tracer infusion.
The glucose disposal rate (M value) was equated to the sum of the average plateau glucose infusion rate (estimated individually, but usually representing the values each 5 min for the last 50  60 min) (Iglucose).
The hepatic glucose production rate (hepatic glucose output, HGO) in the fasted state (HGO Fasted) was assessed using the following equation:
Where Einf is moles fraction excess of the deuterated glucose tracer, Iinf is the rate of infusion (mg/min) of the deuterated glucose tracer, Ep 90-120 is the plateau plasma glucose enrichment (moles fraction excess) during the 30 minutes prior to initiating the insulin infusion.
The post-insulin, hepatic glucose production rate (hepatic glucose output, HGO) was assessed using the following equation:
Where Einf is moles fraction excess of the deuterated glucose tracer, Iinf is the rate of infusion (mg/min) of the deuterated glucose tracer, Ep 210-240 is the plateau plasma glucose enrichment (moles fraction excess) during the last 30 min of the clamp, and Iglucose is the plateau, rate of infusion of unlabeled glucose (glucose infusion rate).
The insulin sensitivity index was defined as the M value (mg/min) divided by the product of the steady state glucose concentration and the average insulin concentration (U/ml) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. post-start of the insulin infusion.
Indirect calorimetry was repeated for 20 min. from approximately 80  100 min after the beginning of the insulin infusion. All infusions were stopped at 240 min except for the dextrose infusion, which was continued and tapered until no longer required to maintain normal glycemia (approximately one hour).
On days 19  21 of each experimental diet, the subjects participated in studies of PA oxidation; these data will be reported separately. During all three days of tracer studies, daily food intake was given as a liquid formula over a period of 9 hrs., while they rested in the CRC. The composition of this formula was identical to the solid food diet for that experimental diet period, and the energy intake (total formula intake) was equal to the solid food intake for at least several days prior to this study period.
On day 21, measurements of O2 consumption, and CO2 production (Vmax SPECTRA 29, Sensor Medics Corp, Yorba Linda, CA) were obtained in the fed state after starting the liquid formula feeding) and once again the next morning in the fasted state (50-min. measurement at 0500).
Repeat blood collection in the fasted and fed state and biopsy of the vastus lateralis in the fasted state were carried out on the 22nd day of each experimental diet (HPA and HOA) as previously described.
On the first day of the Baseline Diet and on day 16 of the HPA and HOA diets, body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, including upper body (android) and lower body (gynoid) regions (GE Lunar Prodigy Densitometer, Version 5.6). In extremely obese individuals (1 male; 2 females) who were too wide to fit adequately on the scanning table, we used the technique of Tataranni to perform a half-body scan to estimate body fat and fat-free mass.
Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol were measured at the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory at The University of Vermont Medical Center using a colorimetric method, and LDL cholesterol was calculated. Glucose concentration was measured using a YSI 2300 Stat Plus glucose analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH), and serum insulin concentration was measured in the CRC Core Laboratory, using a radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, Missouri). HbA1C was measured at The University of Vermont Medical Center by high performance liquid chromatography. Serum concentrations of estrogen and progesterone in females and testosterone in males were measured by The University of Vermont Medical Center using competitive, chemiluminescent immunoassays (Centaur Assay Manual Protocols for estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, Siemens Diagnostics Corp., Malvern, PA).
Plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose enrichment was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode (Agilent 5973; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), as described previously. Prior to measurement, glucose was derivatized to the butylboronate acetate derivative. Injections of butylboronate acetyl glucose were made isothermally while monitoring the [M-57] ions at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 297 and 299 for unlabeled and [6,6-2H2]glucose, respectively. Analyses and equations pertaining to the studies of PA oxidation, which were incorporated into our lipidomic analyses (see below) will be described elsewhere.
We assessed the FA composition of serum phospholipids as well as that of muscle phospholipids, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol in order to ascertain that, in this study, we observed the expected changes in the PA and OA content of these lipids with the respective dietary interventions (HPA and HOA diets). These assays also were incorporated into our principal components analysis as noted below. The concentration of non-esterified serum FA, the FA composition of skeletal muscle diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol, as well as serum and muscle phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin), were analyzed by thin layer chromatography followed by gas chromatography.
On day 8 of the Control/baseline diet and on the 22nd day of each experimental diet (HPA and HOA), blood was collected in the fasted state for measurement of cytokines in plasma and from LPS-stimulated, PBMCs. We enriched lymphocytes and monocytes from blood (PBMCs) using LSM Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and the mononuclear cell layer was collected, washed, and counted. Freshly-collected cells were plated at 106 cells/ml and treated in duplicate under control conditions or were stimulated by the addition of 1ng/ml ultra-pure lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from E. coli 0111:B4, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). After 24-hr., cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at 80° C until analysis. After pilot studies were conducted demonstrating which cytokines were responsive to LPS stimulation in our assays, the following cytokines were measured in these supernatants using a Luminex-based assay: TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). IL-18 was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
The following cytokines were measured in plasma using a Luminex-based assay: IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Total RNA was isolated from muscle biopsies of 16 subjects, after both the baseline diet and each experimental diet using Trizol extraction followed by clean-up using RNeasy Columns, Qiagen Corp.). The RNA was then DNase treated and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iSCRIPT reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with 25 ng of cDNA using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad Chromo4 Sequence Detection System or an Applied Biosystems CFX1000 (Foster, City, CA). Primer sets (Table 1) were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA). Levels of gene expression are presented as average expression relative to -Actin from the same subject as calculated using the CT method. Briefly, the threshold cycle (CT) was determined for the gene of interest and -Actin in each sample and the CT was calculated for each sample by subtracting the CT of -Actin from the CT of the gene of interest. The CT values were calculated by subtracting the CT of the experimental samples from the values on the baseline diet. The CT values were then transformed into relative quantity (rq) values using the equation: rq = 2CT.
In 10 subjects, the muscle biopsy samples were lysed in buffer containing 137mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 130mM NaCl, and 1% NP-40. Proteins were prepared in the same buffer. Insoluble proteins were pelleted via centrifugation, and following protein quantitation of the supernatant, samples were re-suspended in loading buffer with dithiothrietol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF and membranes were probed using a standard immunoblotting protocol using the following primary antibodies: ATF6, CHOP (both from Abcam, Cambridge, MA), ERp57, GRP94 (both from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corporation, San Diego, CA), and -Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Densitometric analyses were performed utilizing BioRad VersaDoc¢ Imager Software (Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, Western Blot x-ray films were imaged and rectangles of identical size were traced around each band and assessed for density (intensity/mm2). Values were normalized to corresponding -Actin bands following background subtraction.
All data are expressed as mean  SEM, and a P value < 0.05 was selected as statistically significant. Cytokine concentrations derived from PBMC secretion were first log transformed before statistical analysis. Analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.2. This study employed a two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence cross-over design. Diet effects were analyzed using a maximum likelihood approach to repeated measures analysis of variance, including sequence, period, and treatment effects, with the baseline value as a covariate, when available. Preliminary analysis of cytokine and gene expression data revealed no statistically significant interaction term for diet and sex or for diet and obesity; thus, data are presented for the entire data set. For some analyses, we employed the same model using ranks. All correlations reported are Spearman rank correlations.
PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to aid in explaining the highest variance within the overall dataset. Orthogonal rotation was employed in the interpretation of the components. The following classes of variables were included in the PCA: serum and muscle phospholipids and muscle diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in the fasted state (including total amounts of each as well as the fractional content of various FA); whole body fat mass, fat-free mass, and per cent body fat; in the fed state, whole body PA oxidation rate and relative rate of PA accretion (equated to PA intake minus PA oxidation); in the fasted state: serum, serum LDL, HDL, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol concentration, total serum concentrations of non-esterified FA, serum concentrations of glucose and insulin, and calculated HOMA-IR; in both the fasted and fed states: respiratory exchange ratio, fat oxidation rate, and resting energy expenditure, all derived from indirect calorimetry. Data pertaining to palmitate metabolism, indirect calorimetry, serum FA, and serum concentrations of HbA1C, glucose, and insulin will be specifically reported elsewhere.
An additional purpose of the PCA was to examine how components derived from the PCA might impact the diet effect on the PBMC cytokine secretion data. Therefore, diet differences in component scores were examined using the repeated measures analysis of variance methods described above. In addition, select components were included as time-varying covariates in the analysis to examine the relationship between dependent variables of interest and the component scores.
