The Ethical Committee of Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University approved the study protocol (approval number, 236). The study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.
Immortalized human OSCC-derived cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, Ca9-22, Sa3, HO-1-u-1, and KON) were obtained from the Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) or the RIKEN BRC (Ibaraki, Japan) through the National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) (Tokyo, Japan). Short tandem repeat proï¬les conï¬rmed cellular identity. All OSCC-derived cells were grown in Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium/F-12 HAM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma). Primary cultured human normal oral keratinocytes (HNOKs) were used as a normal control. They were healthy oral mucosa epithelium specimens collected from young patients at Chiba University Hospital. Three independent HNOKs were primary cultured and maintained in Oral Keratinocyte Medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) comprised of 5 ml of oral keratinocyte growth supplement (ScienCell Research Laboratories) and 5 ml of penicillin/streptomycin solution (ScienCell Research Laboratories). 
One hundred six primary OSCC samples and patient-matched normal epithelium were obtained during surgeries performed at Chiba University Hospital. The resected tissues were fixed in 20% buffered formaldehyde solution for pathologic diagnosis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Histopathologic diagnosis of each OSCC samples was performed according to the World Health Organization criteria by the Department of Pathology of Chiba University Hospital. Clinicopathologic staging was determined by the TNM classification of the International Union against Cancer. All patients had OSCC that was histologically confirmed, and tumoral samples were checked to ensure that tumoral tissue was present in more than 80% of specimens.
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. cDNA was generated using 5 µg total RNA from OSCC-derived cell lines using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and oligo (dT) primer (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan) according to the manufacturers instructions. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged briefly. The cell pellets were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in a lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% w/v CHAPS, and 10 mM Tris pH 7.4) with a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Diagnostics). The protein concentration was measured with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL).
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using LightCycler 480 apparatus (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Primers and universal probes were designed using the Universal Probe Library (Roche Diagnostics) which speciï¬es the most suitable set. The primer sequences used for qRT-PCR were: KIF4A, forward, 5-TCTGTTTCAGGCTGCTTTCA -3; reverse, 5-GCCCTG AAATATTTGATTGGAG -3; and universal probe 25, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) , forward, 5-CATCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCTGA-3; reverse, 5-GGATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCT-3; and universal probe 60. The transcript amount for KIF4A was estimated from the respective standard curves and normalized to GAPDH transcript amount determined in corresponding samples. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and three independent preparations of RNA were analyzed from each cell line.
Protein extracts (20 µg) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 412% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-KIF4A polyclonal antibody (Gene Tex, San Antonio, TX), mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-CDC20 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-cyclin B1 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline, incubated with secondary antibody and coupled to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo), and immunoblotting was visualized by exposing the membranes to ATTO Light-Capture II (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Signal intensities were quantitated using the CS Analyzer version 3.0 software (ATTO).
OSCC cellular lines (HSC-3 and Ca9-22) were transfected with KIF4A shRNA (shKIF4A) or control shRNA (shMock) vectors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagents (Invitrogen). After transfection, the stable transfectants were isolated by the culture medium containing 2 ng/mL Puromycin (Invitrogen). Two to three weeks after transfection, viable colonies were transferred to new dishes. shKIF4A and shMock cells were used for further experiments.
The transfectants were plated on chamber slides (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 50% confluency, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 minutes, then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 as previously described. We used the following primary antibodies to detect SAC activation: rabbit anti-KIF4A polyclonal antibody (Gene Tex), mouse anti-BUB1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-MAD2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fixed cells were incubated with a blocking solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at 37°C. The secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and Texas-Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the sections were washed three times with PBS and mounted using Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescence was performed by confocal microscopy and analyzed with the Fluoview software (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).
To synchronize cells at the G0/G1 or G2/M transition, the cells were deprived of serum for 48 hours or treated with 200 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 20 hours. To determine the cell-cycle distribution, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and probed with CycleTEST Plus DNA reagent kit (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow cytometric determination of DNA content was analyzed by BD AccuriTM C6 Flow Cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). The fractions of the cells in the G0-G1, S, and G2-M phases were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
The transfectants were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1  104 viable cells per well. Cells were harvested for 168 hours, and counted every 24 hours. At the indicated time points, the cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer in triplicate samples.
IHC was performed on 4-µm sections of paraffin-embedded specimens using rabbit anti-KIF4A polyclonal antibody (Gene Tex). Briefly, after deparaffinization and hydration, the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 30 minutes incubation in a mixture of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution in 100% methanol; the sections were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 1.5% blocking serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS before reacting with anti-KIF4A antibody at 4°C in a moist chamber overnight. Upon incubation with the primary antibody, the specimens were washed three times in PBS and treated with Envision reagent (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) followed by color development in 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAKO). The slides then were slightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol, cleaned with xylene, and mounted. Nonspecific binding of an antibody to proteins other than the antigen sometimes occurred. As a negative control, triplicate sections were immunostained without exposure to primary antibodies, which confirmed the staining specificity (Figure S1A). To quantify the status of KIF4A protein expression in those components, we used the IHC scoring systems described previously. In summary, the mean percentages of positive tumoral cells were determined in at least three random fields at 400 magnification in each section. The intensity of the KIF4A-immunoreaction was scored as follows: 0+, none; 1+, weak; 2+, moderate; and 3+, intense. The cellular number and the staining intensity were multiplied to produce a KIF4A IHC score. We considered the staining intensity of the skeletal muscle cells, which were positive controls for KIF4A (Figure S1B). Cases with a KIF4A IHC score exceeding 95.0 (+3 standard deviation [SD] score for normal tissue) were defined as KIF4A-positive. The 3-SD cutoff, which statistically just 0.2% of the measurement would be expected to fall outside this range, was used because it was unlikely to be affected by random experimental error produced by sample manipulation. Two independent pathologists from Chiba University Hospital, neither of whom had any knowledge of the patients clinical status, made these judgments.
In comparisons of KIF4A expression levels, statistical significance was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney's U test. Relationships between KIF4A-immunohistochemical staining scores and clinicopathological profiles were evaluated by Ï2 test, Fisher's exact test, and Mann-Whitney's U test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. The data are expressed as the mean  standard error of the mean (SEM).
