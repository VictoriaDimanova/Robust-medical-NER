A total of 18 nonsmoking adults (men and women) were examined: 8 patients with persistent mild to moderate asthma defined according the GINA criteria and 10 healthy subjects who comprised the control group. The patients were recruited from the Department of Pulmonology and Immunology, Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (BE-2-13), and each participant gave his/her informed written consent.
Patients with asthma had a clinical history of the disease for ¥1 year, current symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness and positive skin prick test (¥3 mm) in response to house dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pteronyssinus) or Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae). All patients were not using inhaled, nasal or oral steroids at least 1 month before visits, short-acting 2 agonists at least 12 h and long-acting 2 agonists at least 48 h prior the lung function test, antihistamines and antileukotrienes  7 days before skin prick test and prior the lung function test. None of the patients had a history of smoking. Baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was more than 70 % of the predicted value in all patients. All healthy subjects were nonsmokers, without symptoms of rhinitis or asthma, with normal findings of spirometry and methacholine challenge, and all showed negative results of skin prick test (Table 1).
All subjects were informed about the requirements for participation in the study, informed written consent was obtained, inclusion/exclusion criteria were verified, and physical examination, spirometry, a methacholine challenge test, and a skin prick test were performed. Peripheral blood was taken if an individual met the criteria for the study. After extraction of eosinophils, for each study participant a separate co-culture with healthy ASMC was prepared. ASMC were cultured for 3 days in medium with serum and 1 day in serum-free medium with insulin-transferrin-selenium reagent, as described below, before co-culture. After 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min of co-culture, eosinophil adhesion was measured. After 24 h of co-culture, samples were collected for gene expression analysis. ASMC proliferation was measured after 48 and 72 h. Before the collection of samples for gene expression analysis and before ASMC proliferation measurements, all wells were incubated for 4 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) until eosinophils detached from ASMC. This was done to avoid errors in gene expression and ASMC proliferation results caused by nonhomogeneous ASMC preparations. EDTA is a chelator of divalent ions than can suppress eosinophil adhesion through integrins by binding calcium ions. Because adhesion of eosinophils to ASMC is weaker than adhesion of ASMC to culture dishes, the incubation with PBS and EDTA allowed separation of these two types of cells. To confirm complete removal of eosinophils from ASMC, the cultures were observed through a microscope after all experiments. Samples for gene expression were lysed and cell proliferation was measured immediately after removal of EDTA from the culture to avoid adverse effects on cell viability.
Pulmonary function was tested using a pneumotachometric spirometer CustovitM (Custo Med, Germany). Baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio were recorded as the highest of three reproducible measurements. The results were compared with the predicted values matched for age, body height, and sex according to the standard methodology.
Airway responsiveness was assessed as changes in airway function after challenge with inhaled methacholine using a reservoir method. Methacholine was nebulized into a 10-L reservoir with a pressure nebulizer (Pari Provocation I; Pari, Stanberg, Germany). Aerolized methacholine was inhaled through a one-way valve at 5-min intervals starting with 15-g methacholine dose and doubling it until a 20 % decrease in FEV1 from the baseline or the total cumulative dose of 3.87 mg was achieved. The bronchoconstricting effect of each dose of methacholine was expressed as a percentage of decrease in FEV1 from the baseline value. The provocative dose of methacholine causing a¥20 % fall in FEV1 (PD20) was calculated from the log doseresponse curve by linear interpolation of two adjacent data points.
All patients were screened for allergy by the skin prick test using standardized allergen extracts (Stallergenes S.A., France) for the following allergens: D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, cat and dog dandruff, 5 mixed grass pollen, birch pollen, mugwort, Alternaria, Aspergillus and Cladosporium. Temoin was used for a negative control, and histamine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL) was used for a positive control. Skin testing was read 15 min after application. The results of skin prick test were considered positive if the mean wheal diameter was¥3 mm.
The analysis of peripheral blood cells was performed on an automated hematology analyzer XE-5000¢ (Sysmex, Japan).
After baseline FEV1 and FVC measurements, subjects inhaled 10 mL of sterile hypertonic saline solution (3 %, 4 %, or 5 % NaCl, Ivex Pharmaceuticals, USA) at room temperature. Nebulised solution was given for three periods of 5 min at most by an ultrasonic nebuliser ULTRA-NEB¢ (DeVilbiss, USA). The subjects were instructed to cough sputum into containers. If any symptoms occurred, nebulisation was discontinued. It was stopped after expectoration of an adequate amount of sputum. In order to detect a possible decrease in FEV1, spirometry was performed after each inhalation. Sputum was poured into a Petri dish and separated from saliva. A 4-fold volume of freshly prepared 0.1 % dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The mixture was vortexed and placed on ice and rocked on an orbital shaker OS-10 (BIOSAN, Latvia) for 15 min. Next, an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to DTT. The cell pellet was separated using a 40-m cell stainer (Becton Dickinson, USA). The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was aspirated and stored at 70 °C for later analysis. The total cell counts, percentage of epithelial cells, and cell viability were investigated using a Neubauer hemocytometer (Heinz-Herenz, Germany) under a microscope (BX43, OLYMPUS, USA) by employing the Trypan blue exclusion method. The cytospin samples of induced sputum were prepared using a cytofuge instrument (Shandon Southern Instruments, USA). Supernatant with and without DTT was stored in 2 mL microtubes at 70 °C for further researches. The prepared sputum cytospins were stained by the May-Grnwald-Giemsa method for differential cell counts. Cell differentiation was determined by counting approximately 400 cells in random fields of view under a light microscope, excluding squamous epithelial cells. The cells were identified by standard morphological criteria, nuclear morphology, and cytoplasmic granulation.
Peripheral blood samples for eosinophil isolation were collected into sterile Vacutainer tubes with EDTA. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated by high-density gradient centrifugation. The whole blood was layered on Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Finland) and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 min at room temperature, and then PMN were separated by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Eosinophils were separated using a magnetic eosinophil isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, USA). MACS buffer (containing 0.5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2) was prepared by diluting MACS BSA Stock Solution 1:20 in autoMACS Rinsing Solution. The granulocyte pellet was resuspended in cold MACS buffer (40 L per 1107 cells) and incubated with Biotin-Antibody Cocktail (biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD2, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD123, and CD235a (glycophorin A)) (10 L per 1107 cells) for 10 min. After incubation, 20 L of Anti-Biotin MicroBeads (microbeads conjugated to monoclonal mouse anti-biotin IgG1) per 1107 cells was added, mixed, and incubated for an additional 15 min at 4 °C. An LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, USA) was prepared during this time by placing the column in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator and washing it with 2 mL of MACS buffer. A pre-separation filter (30 m; Miltenyi Biotec) was rinsed with MACS buffer and placed on top of the column. The cells were then applied to the pre-separation filter/LS column, and the magnetically labeled non-eosinophils were retained on the column in the magnetic field of the Separator while the unlabeled eosinophils passed through the column. Cells were eluted with 5 mL of MACS buffer and centrifuged (400g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (Biological Industries, Israel) to a final concentration of 2106 cells/mL. Eosinophils were counted using an ADAM automatic cell counter (Witec AG, Switzerland). Blood eosinophil viability was assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion and found to be at least 98 %. To check eosinophil purity after magnetic separation, a diluted eosinophil suspension was fixed with methanol on a glass plate, stained with MayGrunwaldGiemsa dyes, and inspected by light microscopy to determine whether there were any neutrophils in the suspension.
Healthy human ASMC isolated from one donor and immortalized by stable expression of hTERT were used for the experiments. Cells were maintained in 75 cm2 Falcon culture flasks under standard culture conditions of 5 % CO2 in air at 37 °C with medium renewal every 23 days. For all experiments, passaged cells were grown on plastic dishes in DMEM (GIBCO by Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin (2 % v/v; Pen-Strep, GIBCO by Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), amphotericin B (1 % v/v; GIBCO by Life Technologies), and fetal bovine serum (10 % v/v; GIBCO by Life Technologies). Cells were transferred and medium was refreshed every 4872 h. After reaching sufficient confluency, cells were passaged by trypsinization. Cells were serum deprived in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and insulin, transferrin, and selenium reagent (GIBCO by Life Technologies) before each experiment to stop cell proliferation and avoid possible errors in proliferation and gene expression measurements due to the effect of serum in the growth medium.
For all experiments, individual co-cultures of eosinophils and human bronchial smooth muscle cells were prepared. We used 0.5105 viable eosinophils and 2105 ASMC for all experiments except the one shown in Fig. 1, in which 2105 viable eosinophils were used. For cell visualization, we used an inverted microscope (CETI Inverso TC100, Medline Scientific, UK) with a 10/22 mm wide-field eyepiece and PH 10/0.25 objective and an installed CETI Si-5C camera (Si-Cap software, Version 2.1, 2012).
ASMC were seeded in 6-well plates (1104 per well) and grown in DMEM for 3 days in 5 % CO2 at 37 °C. Then, the medium was removed and wells were washed twice with PBS. DMEM without fetal bovine serum but supplemented with 10 % insulin-transferrin-selenium reagent was added, and cells were incubated for 1 day. Next, a co-culture with eosinophils was prepared. Eosinophils were allowed to adhere to ASMC for 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min. After incubation, non-adhered cells were removed and the remaining cells were washed twice with PBS. Eosinophil adhesion was determined by measuring residual eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity of adherent cells as previously described. Because intercellular EPO levels are decreased in eosinophils from asthmatic individuals owing to degranulation, increased EPO activity can be determined for higher numbers of eosinophils stably adhering to the ASMC surface. In Fig. 2 we provide visual confirmation of an increased number of asthma-associated eosinophils stably adhering to ASMC. To assay EPO activity, 462 L of RPMI-1640 medium without phenol red and 462 L of EPO substrate (1 mM H2O2, 1 mM o-phenylenediamine, and 0.1 % Triton X-100 in Tris buffer, pH 8.0) were added to each well. After 30 min at room temperature, 231 L of 4 M H2SO4 was added to each well to stop the reaction and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a microplate reader. Results are expressed relative to substrate oxidation levels in control cells (ASMC cultured without eosinophils). The absorbance in control cells is presented as 100 % and eosinophil adhesion is expressed as the difference from the control value.
Cells were grown in 6-well cluster plates. ASMC proliferation was assessed as described previously. Healthy ASMC were co-cultured with eosinophils isolated from asthma patients and healthy individuals for 48 and 72 h. Thereafter, all cells were washed once with warm PBS and incubated for 4 min with warm PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA to detach eosinophils from ASMC. Proliferation was evaluated by incubating wells with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution containing Alamar blue solution (10 % v/v; Invitrogen¢ by Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Conversion of Alamar blue to the reduced form was dependent on the metabolic activity of ASMC and was assayed by dual-wavelength spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 570 nm and 600 nm. As indicated by the manufacturer, the degree of Alamar blue conversion is proportional to the number of viable cells. The data are expressed as the percent increase or decrease in Alamar blue conversion by ASMC compared with control cells (ASMC cultured without eosinophils), which did not proliferate during the co-culturing period.
ASMC co-cultured with eosinophils and control ASMC (cultured under the same conditions but without eosinophils) were prepared for total RNA extraction by washing the cells with warm PBS and incubating them for 4 min with warm PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA to detach eosinophils. Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Then, real-time PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT¢ 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, as follows: reverse transcription at 48 °C for 30 min; activation of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, UP (Ultra-Pure) at 95 °C for 10 min; and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Real-time PCR data were analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold method (the amount of target gene was normalized to the endogenous reference gene 18S ribosomal RNA). A difference of 1 Cq (Cq=1, where Cq is the amplification cycle number) after normalization to the reference gene indicates a twofold higher expression level of the investigated gene. Relative differences were determined by normalization of test sample Cq values to control sample Cq values with the equation Cq(control)Cq(test). The following primers were used to analyze gene expression: Wnt-5a, Fwd 5-GGG TGG GAA CCA AGA AAA AT-3 and Rev 5-TGG AAC CTA CCC ATC CCA TA-3; TGF-1, Fwd 5-GTA CCT GAA CCC GTG TTG CT-3 and Rev 5-GAA CCC GTT GAT GTC CAC TT-3; 18S rRNA, Fwd 5-CGC CGC TAG AGG TGA AAT TC-3 and Rev 5-TTG GCA AAT GCT TTC GCT C-3; collagen type I1, Fwd 5-AGC CAG CAG ATC GAG AAC AT-3 and Rev 5-TCT TGT CCT TGG GGT TCT TG-3; and fibronectin, Fwd 5-TCG AGG AGG AAA TTC CAA TG-3 and Rev 5-ACA CAC GTG CAC CTC ATC AT-3.
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6 for Windows (Version 6.05, 2014; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Normally distributed data are presented as mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). Non-normally distributed data are expressed as median and range and were analyzed using nonparametric tests. Significant differences between two independent groups were determined by the MannWhitney U test. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for dependent groups. Statistical significance was assumed at a p value of <0.05.
