The study protocol and informed consent document were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committees of 6 Hospitals (University of Fukui Hospital, its two affiliated facilities; Fukui Chuo Clinic and Yasukawa Hospital, Tanaka Hospital, Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital, and Fukui Prefectural Hospital). This study was registered in UMIN-CTR (ID: UMIN000019020). After being fully informed regarding all aspects of their participation in this study, informed written consent was obtained from all the outpatients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels of 120 mg/dL or more, or TC levels of 220 mg/dL or more, at baseline); (2) all subjects were aged between 20 and 80 years; (3) the diabetic condition of all subjects was stable in that the last 2 values of HbA1c were less than 8.4 % (NGSP) with its percentage change being within 10 %. Fifty-three patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Patients were treated with 2 mg of pitavastatin daily for 3 months. For four patients receiving mild statin (pravastatin, n=3; fluvastatin, n=1), pitavastatin was prescribed in exchange for the mild stain with no washout period. Two patients on fenofibrate were excluded from statistical analyses for investigating the associations of CETP status with lipid-reducing effects of pitavastatin. Dietary and exercise instructions did not change in any patient during the 3-month treatment, and medications that are known to influence lipid metabolism were neither added nor withdrawn. Blood samples were obtained in the post-absorptive state before and after the pitavastatin treatment, and serum was stored at -80 °C until later analysis.
In order to examine postprandial changes in serum CETP levels, blood samples were obtained before and 2 h after breakfast from ten patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were admitted to Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital and then provided written informed consents, and serum was stored at -80 °C until later analysis.
TC, TG, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen, and uric acid serum levels and supernatant LDH levels were measured using a standard enzymatic method. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum Cr levels using the new 3-variable Japanese equation. LDL-C and HDL-C serum levels were measured by direct and chemical measurements using commercial kits (Cholestest-LDL and Cholestest-N HDL, respectively; Sekisui Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Sd LDL-C serum levels were measured using a commercially available kit (sdLDL-C Seiken, Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), the details and validation of which were described previously. HbA1c levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. ApoA-I levels were measured by an immunochemistry system using nephelometry (APOA-I AUTOã»N Dai-ichi, Sekisui Medical). CETP concentrations in the serum were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with monoclonal antibodies (BML, Saitama, Japan). We measured the postprandial serum levels of lipids and proteins for the following reasons: (1) it was difficult to collect fasting blood samples from all patients because approximately 50 % of patients typically underwent a medical examination in the afternoon in the outpatient clinics of the 6 hospitals; (2) a previous study reported that total cholesterol levels were unchanged and HDL-C levels did not change significantly (less than 10 %) in healthy subjects after a meal; (3) we previously reported that no significant difference was observed in serum CETP levels during fasting and 2 h after a meal in healthy subjects; (4) in our pilot study, we observed no significant difference in serum CETP levels before and 2 h after breakfast (2.20.70 vs. 2.10.61 g/mL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=10).
HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line (JCRB1054), were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA USA) supplemented with high glucose (450 mM), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies Corp.), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies Corp.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 and 95 % air at 37 °C. The cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 3105 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with high glucose, 10 % FBS, and antibiotics. Cells grown to semi-confluence were treated for 24 h with DMEM containing T0901317 (Cayman Chemical Co., Michigan, IN, USA; 3 nM to 10 M), pitavastatin (Kowa Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan; 1 to 10 M), or T0901317 plus pitavastatin. Total RNA was extracted from the HepG2 cells thus treated using a commercial instrument (MFX-2100, Toyobo, Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan) and commercially available kit (MagExtractor RNA-, Toyobo, Co., Ltd.). cDNA was synthesized with a High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Life Technologies Corp.) according to the supplied protocol. TaqMan real-time RTPCR was performed with a TaqMan ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Life Technologies Corp.) using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Unlabeled specific primers and TaqMan MGB probes (6-FAM dye-labelled) from Applied Biosystems were used to detect human CETP (assay ID: Hs00163942_m1), human sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c; assay ID: Hs01088691_m1), human LXR- (assay ID: Hs00172885_m1), human LXR- (assay ID: Hs00173195_m1), and human ApoA-I (assay ID: Hs00985000_m1). A TaqMan human -actin MGB (VIC dye-labeled) control reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, accession no: NM_001101) was used to detect human -actin. The CETP, SREBP-1c, LXR-, LXR, ApoA-I, and -actin cDNA templates were quantified separately using standard curves produced via the serial dilution of standard cDNA. The threshold cycle of each sample was converted to a standard cDNA dilution value (arbitrary units). The cDNA contents of CETP, SREBP-1c, LXR-, LXR, and ApoA-I for each sample were normalized to the level of -actin, a housekeeping gene, for quantitative analyses. The averaged mRNA amounts of each gene for control cells were set at 1.0.
Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against LXR- or -, and control siRNA (a non-targeting siRNA) were purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). HepG2 cells (3040 % confluence) were transfected with negative control siRNA or siRNA against LXR- or -, at a final concentration of 25 nmol/L using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturers instructions. After a 48-h incubation, HepG2 cells that had been refreshed with DMEM were treated with or without T0901317 (500 nM) for an additional 24 h and LXR and CETP mRNA expression levels were then analyzed.
HepG2 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (SIGMA-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Ten micrograms of protein was separated on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot SD; BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 0.05 % Tween-20 at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human LXR- (Cosmo Bio.;Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; 1:200 dilution) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against human LXR- (SIGMA-Aldrich; 1:2000 dilution) or against human -actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; 1:1000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The secondary antibodies were visualized using the ECL detection system from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, PA, USA). The signal intensities of specific bands were quantified with a densitometer (ImageQuant TL, GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Continuous variables were expressed as the meanSD. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test proved that all continuous variables fit a normal distribution. Since the reference range of serum CETP levels was not formally defined, several outliers (4.9 g/mL or more) were ascertained by the Smirnov-Grubbs test and omitted from statistical analyses. Differences in continuous variables between pre- and post-treatment were assessed by the paired t-test. Differences in continuous variables between two groups and among three groups were assessed by the Students t-test and ANOVA with Scheff©s post-hoc test. The relationship between clinical variables and LDL-C or sd LDL-C levels was examined by Pearsons analysis or a univariate regression analysis. A p value of <0.3 was used as a criteria for selecting a candidate determinant for multivariate regression analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the independent determinants for LDL C or sd LDL-C at baseline and their percentage changes. When co-linearity was detected among independent variables (correlation coefficient (r) >0.7), that with the strongest univariate correlation with a dependent variable was selected for the multivariate analysis. When investigating correlations between percentage changes in clinical variables and those in LDL-C or sd LDL-C levels, changes in TC and sd LDL-C or LDL-C, respectively, were excluded from independent variables because they were direct results of the change in LDL-C or sd LDL-C levels. A p value of <0.05 (two-tailed tests) was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the JMP system version 5.1.
