For Nampt/PBEF/visfatin transcriptional analysis, 51 CRC patients admitted to Gastrointestinal and General Surgery Department of Wroclaw Medical University or Lower Silesian Oncology Center for Curative Resection were enrolled. Pairs of bowel tissue, derived from adenocarcinomas and resection margin (histopathologically confirmed to be tumor-free), were collected, soaked in RNAlater (Ambion, USA), and stored at 80°C.
Whole blood samples (3mL) were collected prior to any treatment from 36 CRC patients into PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes. 54 whole blood samples from patients with polyps, nonactive inflammatory bowel disease, or irritable bowel syndrome from of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department served as noncancer controls.
Characteristics of study population are given in Tables 1 and 2. There was significant (p < 0.001) difference in age distribution between CRC patients and controls (Table 2). However, Nampt/PBEF/visfatin did not correlate with age either in a whole cohort (r = 0, p = 0.988) or in CRC (r = 0, p = 0.992) or control (r = 0.20, p = 0.154) groups.
For Nampt/PBEF/visfatin analysis on protein level, matched serum and tissue samples from 26 CRC patients were examined. Bowel tissue samples collected for protein analysis (matched cancerous and noncancerous) were rinsed with 0.9% NaCl and deep-frozen while these for comparative mRNA analysis were rinsed and stored in RNAlater. Additionally, serum samples from apparently healthy blood donors from Lower Silesian Center of Blood Donation and Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland (recruited on the basis of standard eligibility criteria for blood donation with an age >40yrs old as an inclusion criterion for the current study), as well as otherwise healthy patients submitted for hernia repair surgery or surgical removal of hemorrhoids were obtained (n = 48). Age of patients was 69.2  12.1 as compared to 65.9  12.5 in controls, p = 0.281, and female to male ratio was, respectively, 11/15 and 26/22, p = 0.466. Within this group of patients, there were four with stage I, 12 with stage II, seven with stage III, and three with stage IV CRC; eight patients with T2 cancers, 13 with T3, and five with T4; and 18 patients without and eight with lymph node involvement.
Mild anemia was defined as hemoglobin level <13g/dL in man and <12g/dL in woman; moderate anemia was defined as hemoglobin <9.5g/dL and severe anemia as hemoglobin <8g/dL.
The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983, and an informed consent has been obtained from patients.
For Nampt/PBEF/visfatin analysis on mRNA level, tissue samples (3040mg) were homogenized using Fastprep 24 Homogenizer (MP Biomedical, USA). RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) with DNase treatment. Whole blood RNA was isolated with PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was quantified with NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoScientific, USA). Its purity was assessed by calculating 260/280 and 260/230 ratios. RNA integrity was evaluated using the Experion platform incorporating LabChip microfluidic technology and Experion RNA StdSens analysis kits (BioRad, USA). Only RNA isolates with quality indicator (RQI) ¥ 7 were used (1, degraded; 10, intact). Contamination with inhibitors was tested by calculating PCR efficiencies (five-fold dilutions, 6-point curve, in duplicate). 0.5g of tissue or 0.25g of whole blood RNA/20L was transcribed using Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Thermo Scientific). Negative transcription controls were prepared and tested for all samples. qPCRs were conducted in triplicate using CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (BioRad) and SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad) with cycling conditions: 30sec activation at 95°C, 5sec denaturation at 95°C, and annealing/extension for 5sec at 61°C, 40 cycles, followed by melting step (6095°C with fluorescent reading every 0.5°C). Reaction mixture contained 2L of cDNA (diluted 1:5), 10L of 2x SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix, 1L of each 10nM forward and reverse target-specific primers, and 6L of water.
 SDHA and TBP have previously been selected as optimal normalizers for CRC whole blood samples (manuscript submitted) and GAPDH and PPIA for colorectal tissue. Primers (Generi Biotech, Czech Republic), spanning at least one intron, were devised, optimized and validated as previously described. Their sequences and efficiencies are presented in Table 3.
For Nampt/PBEF/visfatin analysis on protein level, tissue samples (120170mg) were homogenized 1:2 (w/v) in 10mM Tris-HCl with 1mM EDTA, pH 7.4 buffer, in FastPrep-24 homogenizer (2min., 4.0M/S). Homogenates were centrifuged (14500g, 10min., 6°C) and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at 45°C until analysis.
For circulating Nampt/PBEF/visfatin analysis, blood was drawn by venipuncture and allowed to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuged (15min., 720g) and serum was collected, aliquoted, and kept frozen at 80° until examination.
Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in sera and tissue homogenates was measured by means of flow cytometry-based method utilizing magnetic microspheres conjugated with monoclonal antibodies using the BioPlex 200 platform with HRF (Bio-Rad, USA), incorporating Luminex xMAP technology, and Bio-Plex Pro Human Diabetes Assay Panels. In case of tissue Nampt/PBEF/visfatin, its concentrations were adjusted to total protein level, measured using Bradford method with bovine serum albumin used for standard curve preparation, and expressed as mg of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin per g of total protein content.
Biochemical and hematological parameters were retrieved from medical records. Data on circulating levels of cytokines/growth factors, assessed using Luminex xMAP technology, were retrieved from earlier study.
Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620 (ATCC: CCL-227) from the Polish Collection of Microorganisms (PCM) of the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of Polish Academy of Science, Wroclaw, Poland (PCM-TC046), was grown on 75cm2 cell culture flasks (BD Bioscience, CA, USA) in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v) and 1% (v/v) L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, CA, USA) until 80% confluence, then scraped, and counted using trypan blue (BioRad) and TC20 Automated Cell Counter (BioRad). Subsequently, for proliferation analysis, 2  104cells/well were seeded on 96-well plates (Corning CellBIND surface; Corning, NY, USA) and cultured until 80% confluence at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, at which point medium was replaced with a fresh one with or without 10% FBS (two variants of the experiment) and 0, 20, 100, or 500ng/mL of recombinant visfatin (PeproTech, NJ, USA) for 8 or 24 hours. For Nampt/PBEF/visfatin expression analysis, 3  105cells/well were seeded on plastic, flat bottom, 6-well plates (Corning CellBIND surface) and cultured until 80% confluence at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Next, depending on the nature of the experiment, the complete medium was replaced with fresh one: (a) devoid of serum, except for control cells (serum-supplemented), and grown for 12, 24, and 48 hours in serum withdrawal experiment; (b) devoid of serum in serum induction experiment, all cells being grown without serum for 24h and subsequently medium being changed into serum-supplemented (10% FBS) in all cells except for controls, which were supplemented again with fresh serum-free medium, and harvested after 24 or 48 hours; (c) containing 0, 50, 100, or 200M CoCl2 (Alchem, Poland) for 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours in hypoxia experiment. Upon termination, cells were scratched and lysed with 1mL of TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) and stored at 80°C until RNA isolation, as described in earlier sections. For reverse transcriptase reaction, 500ng of isolated RNA per reaction was used.
Cell proliferation was measured as total protein synthesis using sulforhodamine B (SRB), an anionic dye binding electrostatically to cellular proteins and subsequently fixed, solubilized, and measured spectrophotometrically at OD 510nm. SRB assays were conducted in four technical replicates and the experiment was conducted three times.
In mRNA analysis, QBasePLUS version 2.4 software (Biogazelle BE, Belgium) was used to calculate efficiency-corrected relative quantities normalized to the expression of reference genes for all samples (NRQ). All statistical analyses on NRQ were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 12.7.7 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org/; 2013). Normality and homogeneity of variances were tested using D'Agostino-Pearson and Levene's tests. Data were log-transformed and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and t-test for independent samples with Welch correction or Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U test. Paired samples were analyzed using t-test for dependent samples. Correlation and partial correlation analyses were conducted using Pearson test (r) and correlation with circulating cytokines/growth factors using Spearman test (Ï). Two-factorial ANOVA, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and multiple regression (stepwise method; variable entrance criteria: p < 0.05; variable removal criteria: p > 0.1) were used to coevaluate factors/variables. Frequency analysis was conducted using Fisher test. If not otherwise stated, NRQ data are presented as geometric means with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In protein analysis, data are presented as means with 95% CI and as medians with 95% CI in circulating Nampt/PBEF/visfatin analysis and analyzed using, respectively, t-test (for paired or unpaired observations, the latter with Welch correction for unequal variances, if required) or Mann-Whitney U test. For cell culture experiments, Ct method using efficiency-corrected Cq values was used to evaluate relative differences in target gene expression. All calculated probabilities were two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
