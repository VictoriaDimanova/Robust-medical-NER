The construction of Ad5/3-E2F-24-GMCSF is described in supplementary materials and methods. Ad5/3-24, Ad5/3lucI and Ad5/3-D24-GM-CSF have been described. Cell lines used herein and their testing have been described.
In vitro assays. GMCSF dependent TF-1 erythroleukemia cells (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) were used to evaluate the functionality of GMCSF as described. The results constitute of an average of 7 (mock 21, hGMCSF 11) samples, students T-test was used for statistics. The experiment showed that virus-produced hGMCSF was as bioactive as the commercial positive control (Recombinant human GM-CSF, 2ng/ml, PeproTech, 30003) as reported. Oncolytic potency was tested with MTS-assay performed 6 days (A549 and PC3-MM2) or 14 days (SKOV3.ip1) after virus incubation when 100% cell killing with the highest viral dose was observed. Shown results are the average of four samples, error bars represent standard deviation. Students T-test was used for statistical analyses. Selectivity of virus replication in human primary hepatocytes is described in supplementary materials and methods. In vivo efficacy. Hamster pancreatic cancer tumors (HapT1) were grown subcutaneously in Syrian hamsters as described. At 7 days tumors were injected with 3  108 VP/tumor of either of Ad5/3-E2F-24-GMCSF (n = 6) or Ad5/3-24-GMCSF (n = 5) 3 times every 3 days. Further, 5 animals received cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally (2 mg/hamster) in combination with Ad5/3-E2F-24-GMCSF, 5 hamsters received cyclophosphamide only and 4 animals were mock-treated with intratumoral growth medium injections. Tumor volume was calculated by using a formula of (0.5  length)  (width2).
In vivo tumor selectivity of Ad5/3-E2F-24-GMCSF replication. After hamster HapT1 tumors reached approximately 0,5 cm in diameter (7 days), 3  108 VP of Ad5/3-E2F-24-GMCSF was injected intratumorally (n = 8 tumors/timepoint). Hamsters without tumors (n = 2 hamsters/timepoint) were injected directly into the liver. Animals were killed and tumors or livers collected 0.5, 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours after virus injection, snap-frozen and stored at 80Â°C. Quantitative PCR has been described. Activity of human GM-CSF in Syrian hamsters has been described previously.
Patients were treated in an Advanced Therapy Access Program, regulated by EC/1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products, amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. According to EC/1394/2007 manufacturing of advanced therapy medicinal products shall be authorized by the competent authority of the Member State, which in Finland is the Finnish Medical Agency (FIMEA). FIMEA also requires reporting of adverse reactions. Virus administration was performed by ultrasound-guided intratumoral injection and circa one fifth of the dose was given intravenously during the first treatment only. The rationale for the latter relates to the generally low to average amount of neutralizing antibodies that are typically present at baseline, while after treatment antibodies often increase rapidly and thus the value of subsequent intravenous dosing is unknown. In any case, there is no need for subsequent intravenous injection because the tumor produces virus which is then shed into blood. Thus in subsequent injections the whole dose was given intratumorally. Most patients were treated three times every three weeks. Doses of 1101011 VP were used based on safety results previously published with Ad5/3-24-GMCSF, a related virus lacking the E2F1 promoter. All patients exluding C332 received low dose cyclophosphamid for reduction of regulatory T-cells. Patients H192, 344, I347, S352 and S354 received also low dose temozolomide for enhancement of autophagy during oncolysis. Typically, cyclophosphamide was used throughout the treatments with a dose of 50mg/day while temozolomide was used 57 days before and/or 714 days after the treatment at 100mg/day. Neither approach is known to have anti-tumor activity on their own. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients were monitored overnight at the clinic and then as outpatients for 28 days for adverse events. Adverse reactions were recorded according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events v3.0. Survival and late adverse events were followed ad infinitum. ATAP treatments are not a trial but an individualized treatment program. However, in a separate research project, collection and analysis of biopsies was approved by the HUCH operative ethics committee, and a separate informed consent procedure was employed to ensure separation of research from treatment (Dnro 368/13/03/02/2009). Other patient sample analyses are also approved by the local Ethics Committee (HUS 62/13/03/02/2013). Because many cancer patients have symptoms due to disease, preexisting symptoms were not scored if they did not become worse. However, if the symptom became more severe, e.g., pretreatment grade 1 changed to grade 2 after treatment, it was scored as grade 2. The neutralizing antibody assay and the determination of virus genomes in blood are previously published. Interferon gamma ELISPOT is described, all results were compared to cells spontaneously producing the cytokine, i.e. PBMCs without stimulation.
