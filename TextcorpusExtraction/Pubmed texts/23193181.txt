All participants were given oral and written information before written informed consent was obtained. The protocol was approved by the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency, and the study was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki II. According to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01150955) before recruitment was initiated.
Twenty-four male volunteers, aged 1870 years, participated. All participants were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2) but otherwise healthy, were taking no prescriptive medicine, and had no overt endocrine disorders. Eligibility ultimately was based on a normal physical examination including routine clinical biochemistry and electrocardiography.
The study was an investigator-initiated randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The subjects were treated for 4 weeks with tablets containing 500 mg trans-resveratrol (Fluxome Inc., Stenlose, Denmark) or placebo (Robinson Pharma, Santa Ana, CA) thrice daily. Randomization, blinding, packaging, and labeling was performed by the pharmacy at Aarhus University Hospital. The randomization code was unblinded once all predefined data were recorded.
During the trial period, the subjects were instructed to abstain from using nutritional supplements and consuming food suspected to contain resveratrol in significant amounts. Furthermore, the importance of maintaining their normal way of living was underscored. The compliance rate, defined as the proportion of tablets ingested relative to the intended number, was calculated when participants returned the remaining tablets during the last examination.
Examinations were performed on 3 consecutive days both at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with the same equipment and by the same physicians and laboratory technicians on both occasions.
On the first day we performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and initiated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings. On the second day, we conducted magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and imaging, and on the third day and after an overnight fast the participants underwent a full-day metabolic investigation including a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with continuous infusion of a primed glucose tracer, indirect calorimetry, repetitive blood sampling, and muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.
When completing the full-day metabolic investigation at baseline, the tablets were provided and the subjects were instructed to initiate tablet consumption in the evening and subsequently three times daily until the overnight fast before the third examination day at week 4. At weeks 2, 4, and 6, potential adverse events were recorded, and fasting blood samples were drawn for safety purposes. Urine from the first void was collected for pharmacokinetic purposes in the morning of the third examination day at week 4.
After an overnight fast (from 10:00 p.m.), the participants presented to the research unit at 7.30 a.m. and were studied in the supine position during thermoneutral conditions in the fasting state for 6 h.
For the purpose of infusions, a catheter (Venflon; Viggo, Helsingborg, Sweden) was inserted into the antecubital vein. Another catheter was placed in a heated dorsal hand vein for sampling of arterialized blood. Samples were drawn at 0, 160, 170, 180, 340, 350 and 360 min; while the clamp was in place, plasma glucose levels were determined every 10 min.
The participants were studied from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (0360 min) (Supplementary Fig. 1). After a 3-h basal period (0180 min), they were clamped at a blood glucose level of 5 mmol/L with a 0.5 mU/kg/min insulin infusion (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv¦rd, Denmark) for the last 3 h (180360 min) by adjusting the infusion rate of 20% glucose (GIR) in response to blood glucose measurements every 10 min. After emptying the bladder at 0 min, urine was collected at the end of both the basal and clamp periods and the volume was measured.
Under sterile conditions and using local anesthesia (Lidocaine SAD 10 mg/mL; Amgros, Copenhagen, Denmark) skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at the end of the basal period and 20 min into the clamp period (140 and 200 min, respectively). The muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle using a Bergstrm biopsy needle. The muscle tissue was immediately dissected free from fat and connective tissue and transferred to liquid nitrogen. Subcutaneous abdominal fat was obtained by liposuction 15 cm lateral to the umbilicus, cleaned, and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
A primed continuous infusion of [3-3H]-glucose was given during the entire 6-h basal/clamp procedure (bolus 20 µCi followed by 0.19 µCi/min; NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). To avoid rapid dilution of [3-3H]-glucose during the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, [3-3H]-glucose was added to the infused glucose (100 µCi [3-3H]-glucose/500 ml 20% glucose).
Specific activity of [3-3H]-glucose was measured, and glucose rate of appearance (Ra) and rate of disappearance (Rd) was calculated at 10-min intervals from 150 to 180 and 330 to 360 min using Steeles non-steady-state equation.
Under basal conditions, the endogenous glucose production (EGP) equals Ra, and during the clamp period, EGP is calculated by subtracting the mean GIR from Ra. Nonoxidative glucose disposal is derived by subtracting oxidative glucose disposal from total glucose disposal (Rd).
The respiratory quotient (RQ) and resting energy expenditure (REE) were estimated by indirect calorimetry (Deltatrac; Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) performed at 90120 min and 270300 min in the basal and clamp periods, respectively. Mean values taken during the last 25 min were used for calculations. Glucose and lipid oxidation rates were estimated after correction for protein oxidation, which was calculated on the basis of urea nitrogen excretion. Urinary urea content was measured by absorption photometry (ROCHE cobas 6000C, Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany).
Plasma glucose was measured in duplicate immediately after sampling on an YSI 2300 Stat Plus (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), alanine aminotranferase, and leukocytes were analyzed at the University Hospital Department of Clinical Biochemistry using standard methods. All other parameters were analyzed on serum that had been frozen and stored (80°C) immediately after being drawn and centrifuged.
Total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides were determined by absorption photometry (ROCHE cobas 6000C, Roche Applied Science), and LDL subsequently was calculated using the Friedewald formula.
Insulin was analyzed using time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (AutoDELFIA Insulin kit, catalog no. B080101, PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) and free fatty acids (FFAs) by a commercially available kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Glucagon and adiponectin were measured by in-house radioimmunoassay and time-resolved immunofluorometric assay, respectively.
Finally, C-peptide (DakoCytomation, Cambridgeshire, UK); cortisol (Cortisol ELISA, DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany); interleukin 6 (Human IL-6 Quantikine HS ELISA Kit [HS600B], R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Human CCL2/MCP-1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (DCP00), R&D Systems); tumor necrosis factor  (Human TNF- Quantikine HS ELISA [HSTA00D], R&D Systems); high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP High Sensitive ELISA (EIA-3954), AH Diagnostics, Aarhus, Denmark); and leptin (Leptin ELISA E07, Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Germany) were analyzed using commercially available ELISA kits.
Hormones relevant to the clamp procedure (C-peptide, FFA, insulin, cortisol, adiponectin, glucagon) were measured at 0, 160, 170, 180, 340, 350, and 360 min and expressed as mean values of basal and clamp triplicates, respectively; the remainder were measured at 0 min. Homeostasis model assessmentinsulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the standard formula, based on fasting glucose and insulin.
Intrahepatic and intramyocellular fat content as well as visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) volumes were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) techniques using a Signa Excite 1.5 Tesla twin-speed scanner (GE Medical Systems, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.). MR spectroscopy of the skeletal muscle included a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (water suppression; echo time 27 ms; repetition time 3000 ms) on a 2  2  2 cm voxel positioned in the largest cross-sectional area of the tibialis anterior muscle. Full width at half maximum was 13.4  2.2 Hz. The 1H-MR liver spectroscopy technique has been described previously; full width at half maximum was 13.7  3.3 Hz. The spectra were quantified by using the LCmodel software package (version 6.2; Stephen Provencher) by means of a dedicated muscle and liver spectroscopy fitting model. The data processing provided an estimate of the ratio of lipid to water in the tissue within the voxel. VAT and SAAT volumes were quantified by MR imaging (body coil; fast-spin echo sequence; echo time 8.5 ms; repetition time 600 ms; slice thickness 8 mm; field of view 48 cm). On the basis of repetitive axial slices from the proximal border of the left kidney to the femur neck, data processing was done using the software package Hippofat.
Whole-body bone mineral density and body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery scanner S/N 80027; Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA).
Noninvasive, 24-h, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed based on measurements every 20th minute (Spacelabs, model 90217).
Frozen muscles biopsies (30 mg) were homogenized in ice-cold solubilization buffer, and samples were rotated for 60 min at 4°C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 16,000g for 20 min at 4°C, and the protein content of the protein-containing supernatant was determined.
Aliquots of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and incubated with primary antibody. All primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). To determine relative phosphorylation levels, phospho-specific blots were stripped in SDS buffer and reprobed with the primary antibody for the detection. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (Amersham, GE-Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) was used as the secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Supersignal West Dura; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) using a ChemiDoc XRS+ CCD camera (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Total RNA was isolated from muscle and adipose tissue using Trizol (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Roskilde, Denmark); RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm with a ratio ¥1.8 using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Integrity of the RNA was checked by visual inspection of the two ribosomal RNAs (18S and 28S) on an agarose gel. cDNA was synthesized with the Verso cDNA kit AB 1453 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) using random hexamers. Real-time PCR for target genes was done with 2-microglobulin levels as the internal control, and this expression did not change during intervention. Sequences of the primers used are given in Supplementary Table 1.
The PCR reactions were performed in duplicate using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA) in a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) using the following protocol: One step at 95°C for 3 min, then 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 10 s. The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step. The relative gene expression was estimated using the default Advanced Relative Quantification mode of the software version LCS 480 1.5.0.39 (Roche Applied Science).
Concentrations of urinary resveratrol metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet/visible detection according to the following method: Aliquots of 2 mL urine were loaded onto conditioned polyamide solid phase extraction cartridges (180 mg), which were washed with 10 mL of water and 5 mL of methanol. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness, and the residues dissolved in 200 µL of 80% acetonitrile before 10 µL was injected for HPLC analysis.
Plasma samples (200 µL) were extracted with 500 µL acetonitrile (100%), mixed, and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was evaporated and redissolved in 200 µL acetonitrile (10%), and 10 µL was injected for HPLC analysis.
Metabolites were separated using aqueous ammonium formate (10 mmol/L; pH = 8.2) or aqueous formic acid (0.1%; pH 2.5) as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B in the mobile phase (flow rate 0.5 mL/min) with the following gradient: 10%B linear (010 min), 1040%B linear (1040 min), 4099%B linear (4043 min), 99%B linear (4348 min). A HyperClone C18 reverse-phase column (length 150 mm, internal diameter4.6 mm, particle size 3 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) protected by precolumn was used. Detection of metabolites was performed at » = 300 nm. All metabolites were quantified by external standard calibration. Recoveries of resveratrol were measured by spiking blank urine and plasma samples at the final concentration: from 7.8 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL for urine and from 0.01 µg/mL to 0.05 µg/mL for plasma. Metabolite equivalents were recalculated using standard calibration curves for resveratrol. The structures of metabolites were interpreted by negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization liquid chromatographymass spectrometry/mass spectrometry under the HPLC conditions described earlier; these experiments were performed on an LTQ XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Results are presented as means  SEM when normally distributed and median (range) when not. Unless otherwise noted, the main treatment comparisons between the two groups were assessed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Normality was checked by QQ-plots, and test for equal variance was assessed by the Levenes test for equal variances. If skewed, the data were logarithmically transformed before applying ANOVA. When revealing significant differences, post hoc pairwise multiple comparison procedures were performed using the Student-Newman-Keuls method.
When appropriate, one-way ANOVA was used on normally distributed data, and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks was used when they were not normally distributed. Baseline comparisons were done by unpaired Student t test. Before applying a nonparametric test, the data were logarithmically transformed. If the data were normally distributed, the unpaired Student t test was used. If the data were not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used.
Within-group comparisons were analyzed by paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. P values <0.05 were considered significant. Power calculations were based on changes in M value. To detect a treatment difference of 1.0 mg/kg/min at a two-sided 0.05 significance level with a power of 0.90, nine participants had to be included in each group, assuming an SD of 0.6.
