Fresh human abdominal skin, obtained from a Caucasian donor undergoing an abdominoplasty (female aged 46 years old) was collected and maintained in a holding medium consisting of HEPES buffered DMEM containing antibiotics and antifungals. The epidermis was removed from the dermis after overnight incubation at 4 °C with dispase in the holding medium and then underwent trypsin digestion. The keratinocyte suspension was seeded on 3 T3 fibroblasts and rendered mitotically inactive by mitomycin C treatment. Human keratinocyte monolayers were cultured for 6 days in DMEM (2 mM Ca2+), with 10 % FCS, L-glutamine (2 mM), insulin (5 g/mL), hydrocortisone (0.4 g/mL), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/mL), penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL), at 37 °C, in 95 % air/5 % CO2 atmosphere, with 95 % relative humidity. After 6 days, the 3T3 feeder cells were removed from the human keratinocyte cultures by a trypsin/EDTA treatment. The next day, the human keratinocytes were removed by trypsinization. The human keratinocyte suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in fresh culture medium, and then strained through a series of filters. Cells (1.5x105/well) were then seeded into 96-well plates with 200 L of EpiLife medium and 60 M calcium, antibiotics, and human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS) per well. Human tissue samples for the isolation of keratinocytes (described above) and skin explants (described below) were obtained in accordance with the Human Tissue Act of 2004 (England Wales and Northern Ireland) and collected with the appropriate donor consent.
RTA 408 (3, 30, 100, 300, 700, and 1000 nM), vehicle (DMSO, 0.1 % final concentration), or nothing (media control) was incubated with cells in two separate 96-well plates (1.5 x 105 cells per well) for 16 h. At the time of harvest, one plate utilized the MTT assay (Invitrogen, V13154) to examine cell viability, and one plate was processed for QuantiGene Plex 2.0 analysis (i.e., mRNA expression of Nrf2 target genes), according to manufacturers instructions and as previously reported.
Skin, obtained from a female reduction mammoplasty (48 year old donor), was collected and placed in a holding medium consisting of HEPES buffered DMEM containing antibiotics and antifungals. The fat was removed, and a 5-mm punch biopsy was used to cut 30 biopsies. Biopsies were cultured at the air-liquid interface with 5 mL of DMEM media (2 mM Ca2+), 10 % FCS, L-glutamine (2 mM), insulin (5 g/mL), hydrocortisone (0.4 g/mL), EGF (10 ng/mL), penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL), at 37 °C, in a 95 % air/5 % CO2 atmosphere, with 95 % relative humidity. The dermis of each culture was immersed in the media, while the epidermis was in contact with air.
Skin cultures were split into 5 treatment groups. RTA 408 (0.03, 0.3, or 3 %), vehicle (sesame oil), or nothing (media control) was applied topically twice daily for 2 days and once on Day 3. Approximately 50 L of RTA 408 or vehicle was applied to the entire surface of the skin cultures. Prior to each application, a visual inspection of the skin cultures confirmed there was no residual RTA 408 or vehicle from the previous administration. All skin cultures were harvested 8 h after the final administration on Day 3, with half of the replicates fixed for 24 h in phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.07.4), transferred to 70 % ethanol, then processed and paraffin-embedded, according to standard histological techniques. The remaining skin samples were snapped frozen.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) was quantified using Quantigene Plex 2.0 technology according to manufacturers protocol (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and as previously described. Probe sets were designed against the human genome for analysis of Nrf2 target genes, and a modified version of Panel 11834 (Affymetrix) was used. Human primary keratinocyte data were normalized to the housekeeping gene PPIB. Human skin explant data were normalized to the average of housekeeping genes RPL13A and PPIB.
Levels of NQO1 protein in skin sections were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using previously described methods. NQO1 staining intensity of 5X magnification photomicrographs was quantified using ImageJ software v1.46 with the Densitometry 1 plug-in, both freely available from the National Institutes of Health (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html).
The clinical study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02029716) enrolled healthy adults (male and female) aged 18 to 65 years, with Fitzpatrick skin type I to IV, and a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2. Demographic data are presented in Table 1. The study was conducted sequentially in 3 parts to assess the safety, tolerability, PD, and PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily (BID), at 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., for up to 28 days. For each application, the appropriate amount of lotion was applied to the skin and gently massaged for the appropriate time (Parts A and B: 1015 s; Part C: 45 s). The areas of application were allowed to dry for 5 min, and then the entire area was covered with loose-fitting gauze to keep the lotion confined during normal activities.
Part A was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of the safety, local skin tolerability, PD, and PK of 3 concentrations of RTA 408 Lotion (0.5 %, 1 %, and 3 %, w/w) compared to lotion vehicle (0 %) applied topically to 12 healthy subjects BID for 14 days to a small skin surface area on the lower back (4 cm2 for each concentration). Part B was open-label and assessed the safety, tolerability, PD, and PK of the highest tolerated dose of RTA 408 Lotion from Part A (i.e., 3 %) applied topically to 10 healthy subjects BID for 14 days to a larger skin surface area on the lower back (100 cm2). During the dosing period in Parts A and B, subjects were confined to the study site for 15 days. Part C was open-label and assessed the safety, tolerability, PD, and PK of RTA 408 Lotion (3 %) concentration applied BID to an even larger skin surface area (500 cm2) on the backs of 10 healthy subjects for 28 days. During the dosing period in Part C, subjects were confined to the study site for 29 days. Total daily doses of RTA 408 for Parts A, B, and C were approximately 1.8, 30, and 150 mg/day, respectively. The assessment of safety was based primarily on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events, Modified Draize Skin Irritation Assessments, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), and vital signs.
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected for determination of plasma RTA 408 concentrations prior to dosing and 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h after the first topical application of RTA 408 Lotion on Days 1, 7, and 14 of Parts A, B, and C and also on Day 28 for Part C. A validated LC/MS/MS method with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.074 ng/mL and an upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) of 37.0 ng/mL was used for quantification of RTA 408 in plasma samples.
Punch biopsies (3 mm) for evaluation of induction of NQO1 protein expression, the prototypical Nrf2 target gene, were collected the day following the final dose in each part of the study. A local injection of lidocaine HCl (1 %) was used for anesthesia. Biopsies were incubated in formalin at room temperature for 24 h and then transferred to 70 % ethanol. NQO1 IHC on the skin biopsies was performed as described above.
The protocol and informed consent documents were submitted to and approved by the duly constituted Western Institutional Review Board prior to initiation of the clinical study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all applicable laws and regulations of the locale and country where the study was conducted, and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.
Nrf2 target gene data were analyzed with Sigmaplot 12.0 (Systat, Inc., San Jose, CA) by students t-test or by one way-analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncans Multiple Range post-hoc test with significance set at p<0.05.
