Atherosclerotic plaques were obtained from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for atherosclerotic carotid disease. Patients were referred to as symptomatic when suffering from stroke, transient ischemic attack or amaurosis fugax. CEA was performed when internal carotid artery stenosis was >70%. CEA specimens were divided into different parts that were either snap frozen at 80째C or fixed in formaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. The study was performed conform to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board. All patients provided informed consent.
Histochemical stainings were performed on paraffin sections of all plaques to assess general morphology (PAS staining), intraplaque hemorrhage and fibrous cap thickness (Martius, Scarlet and Blue; MSB staining).
For immunostaining, frozen sections were fixed in 100% acetone, and cultured HMEC-1 cells were fixed in 90% acetone/10% dH2O at 20째C for 10minutes. Sections or cells were subsequently stained for human CSE (mouse IgG1  monoclonal, Abnova, clone S51), human vWF (rabbit polyclonal, Dako, ref: A0082), human SMA (mouse IgG2a  monoclonal, Dako, ref: M0851), human CD34 (mouse IgG1  monoclonal, Dako, clone QBEnd-10, code number M7165), or human CD68 (mouse IgG3  monoclonal, Dako, clone KP-1). Following incubation with primary antibodies (1hr, room temperature), sections/cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (CSE and SMA) or goat-anti-rabbit IgG (vWF) polyclonal antibodies (Dako). 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) or 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as chromogen, and nuclei were counterstained using hematoxylin.
For CSE/vWF immunohistochemical double staining, frozen sections of plaques were fixed in 100% acetone, and incubated with mouse IgG1 anti-human-CSE for 1hour at room temperature. Sections were subsequently incubated with goat-anti-mouse IgG1 biotin labeled, and streptavidin-HRP. HRP-activity was visualized using AEC. Sections were then incubated with the rabbit anti-human-vWF for another hour, followed by incubation of goat-anti-rabbit-alkaline phosphatase and stained using FastBlue (Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). For SMA/CSE immunohistochemical double staining, frozen sections of plaques were fixed in 100% acetone, and incubated with mouse IgG2a anti-human-SMA for 1hour, followed by goat-anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP. HRP-activity was visualized using DAB. After that, sections were incubated with the second primary antibody, mouse IgG1 anti-human-CSE for 1hour, followed by incubated with goat-anti-mouse IgG1 biotin labeled, and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and stained using FastRed. Nuclei were counterstained using hematoxylin.
Immunofluorescent double labeling for CSE and vWF or CSE and SMA was performed as described above using goat-anti-mouse-IgG1-TRITC (for CSE) and goat-anti-rabbit-FITC (for vWF) or goat-anti-mouse-IgG2a-FITC (for SMA) (SouthernBiotech) as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Primary antibody was replaced by PBS in negative controls.
All 19 carotid atherosclerotic plaque specimens were assessed for vulnerability. For plaque vulnerability score, the following criteria were taken into account: microvessel density, thickness of the fibrous cap, CD68+ macrophage infiltration and the presence of intraplaque hemorrhage. Intraplaque microvessel density was determined in two hotspots. A hotspot is defined as one field of view at 200 magnification. CD34+ microvessels were manually counted in two hotspots, and mean number of CD34+ microvessels per mm2 was calculated. Microvessel density resulted in the following vulnerability score; (0) less then 10 microvessel per mm2, (1) between 10 and 20 microvessels per mm2, and (2) more then 20 microvessels per mm2. Fibrous cap thickness was based upon the MSB staining. The visually thinnest part of the fibrous cap was measured, and scored according to the Critical Cap Thickness criteria; (0) the thinnest part of the fibrous cap was >200m, and (1) the thinnest part of the fibrous cap was <200m. Inflammation in the plaque was assessed by measurement of CD68+ macrophages. CD68 stained sections were scanned using the NanoZoomer 2.0HT Digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Japan) and analyzed for positive pixel area (CD68) using the Aperio Positive Pixel Analysis v9.1 algorithm. CD68 staining resulted in the following vulnerability score; (0) less then 2% CD68 positive pixel area, and (1) more then 2% CD68 positive pixel area. Finally, intraplaque hemorrhage was determined, based on the MSB staining and resulted in the following vulnerability score; (0) no detectable intraplaque hemorrhage, and (2) detectable intraplaque hemorrhage. The total sum of the scores was calculated to a total vulnerability score. A score lower then 4 was defined as stable plaque, and a score of 4 or higher was defined as vulnerable plaque.
Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were kindly provided by Dr. E.W. Ades (CDC, Atlanta, USA) via Prof. G. Molema and the UMCG Endothelial Cell Facility. Cells were cultured in M-199 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (HyClone), 10% (v/v) human serum (Lonza), 2mM L-glutamine (Lonza) and 100U/ml penicillin and 100g/ml streptomycin (Lonza). Cells were expanded in T75 flasks (Corning) at 37째C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For immunophenotyping, cells were cultured on coverslips. Tube formation assays were performed as described below.
Endogenous H2S production by CSE was downregulated by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Two different CSE siRNAs were used for this purpose (Silencer Select siRNA, s3710 and s3711, Life Technologies). Scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control (Silencer Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA 4390843). Experiments were performed following the users guide. Briefly, 200l opti-MEM reduced medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) per well was added in a 12-well plate. To each well 4.8l siRNA (2.5mol/L) was added, as well as 2l Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). Next, 1ml of cell-suspension was added per well, resulting in a final concentration of 10nmol/L siRNA. After 24, 48, and 72hours, cells were harvested for PCR analysis and western blot analysis. In order to accomplish more pronounced knockdown, double CSE knockdown with the 2 CSE siRNAs was performed. For double CSE knockdown experiments 200l opti-MEM reduced medium per well was added in a 12-well plate. To each well either 4.8l scrambled siRNA (2.5mol/L) and 2l Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was added per well, or 4.8l CSE siRNA 1 and 4.8l CSE siRNA 2 and 4l Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was added per well. Next, 1ml of cell-suspension was added per well, resulting in a final concentration of 10nmol/L per siRNA. 12hours after transfection, GYY4137 (30mM) was administered to a final concentration of 300M GYY4137.
A Matrigel tube formation assay was performed using HMEC-1 cells to study angiogenic capacity of microvascular endothelial cells. Ten l growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was allowed to polymerize at 37째C for 30minutes in Angiogenesis -slides (Ibidi GmbH). HMEC-1 cells were plated on the Matrigel surface (5000 cells/well in 50l serum-free medium). To inhibit CSE activity, DL-propargylglycine (PPG, Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Tube formation was performed in presence of CSE inhibitor PPG using various concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5 and 10mmol/L) in order to inhibit CSE activity. To inhibit CSE mRNA expression two different siRNAs (single or in combination) were used as described above and tube formation was analyzed 40hours after transfection. Slow release H2S compound GYY4137 (kindly provided by M. Whitemann, Exeter, UK) was used as an H2S donor in a concentration of 300mol/L. After 8hours, images were taken from 5 selected areas per well in a standardized way. The total number of branching points in the 5 images was determined using Aperio Imagescope software (Aperio Technologies). The tube formation assay was repeated three times, in which each replicate was performed in triplicate.
To examine cell viability and mitochondrial activity of HMEC-1, a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide (MTT) assay was used according to the manufacturers instruction. In short, HMEC-1 were transfected with siRNA and seeded into 96-well plates (2,500 cells per well). MTT reagent (10l) was added after one hour (t=0), after 24hours (t=1), 48hours (t=2) or 72 hours (t=3). Four hours after MTT administration, formazan crystals were formed, 100l isopropanol with 0.04 N HCl was added and thoroughly mixed to solubilize formazan. Directly after solubilization, the absorbance was measured at 570nm and a reference wavelength of 630nm (Varioskan, Thermo Scientific). The MTT assay was repeated three times.
Migration activity of HMEC-1 cells was studied using the scratch assay. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates to confluence. 24hours after transfection with siRNAs, a scratch was made with a pipette tip of a 200l pipette. The medium was directly changed into serum-free medium and photomicrographs were taken (t=0). Pictures were taken at 4hours (t=1), 8hours (t=2), and 24hours (t=3). Migration potential was expressed as percentage of scratch closure. Each condition in the scratch assay was repeated six times.
Protein was isolated from CEA cryosections (3010m) as well as from cultured HMEC-1 cells using RIPA Buffer supplemented with 1% Halt Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and 1% Halt Protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.1mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 20g/ml trypsin inhibitor. Total protein content of the lysates was determined with the pyrogallol red method as previously described. Briefly, 5l of sample was added in a 96-well plate (Corning), 300l pyrogallol red-molybdate complex was then added. After 10minutes absorbance was measured at 600nm (Varioskan, Thermo Scientific) and protein concentration was calculated against a calibration curve. Equal amounts of protein were boiled and electrophoretically separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Aspecific binding of antibodies was blocked using 5% non-fat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline-0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1hour. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4째C (for CSE; 1:500, mouse monoclonal IgG1, Abnova). -actin (1:1000, mouse monoclonal IgG1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as housekeeping protein. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used as a secondary antibody. All antibody incubations were followed by short washing with TBST. Immunoreactions were visualized by ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and images were taken with the Bio-Rad-ChemiDoc MP system and quantified using ImageJ software.
RNA was isolated from cultured HMEC-1 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). 1ug RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamere primers (Life Technologies). CSE (assay Hs00542284_m1), CBS (assay Hs00163925_m1), 3MST (assay Hs00560401_m1), VEGF-A (assay Hs00900055_m1) and VEGFR2 (assay Hs00911700_m1) mRNA expression was measured with a Taqman Gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems). For normalization, TATA box binding protein (TBP) was included as housekeeping gene using the following primers (FW: GCCCGAAACGCCGAATAT; REV: CCGTGGTTCGTGGCTCTCT) and probe (ATCCCAAGCGGTTTGCTGCGG) (Eurogentec). Reactions were performed on an ABI7900HT thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The comparative Ct method (2Ct method) was used to calculate relative gene expression.
Human VEGF-A was measured in supernatant of cultured HMEC-1 48hours after transfection with different siRNAs (Quantikine ELISA Kit, Catalog# DVE00; R&D Systems). Analysis was performed according to the users guide. In short; 50l Assay Diluent and the standards, blanks and samples (200l) were added to each well. After 2hours incubation, wells were washed three times followed by addition of 200l Conjugate and incubation for 2hours. After 3 times washing, 200l of Substrate Solution was added and incubated at room temperature in the dark. After 20minutes, 50l Stop Solution was added per well and within 30minutes absorbance was measured at 450nm (Varioskan, Thermo Scientific). VEGF-A concentration was then calculated by using the calibration curve.
All data were analyzed with GraphPad PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test where appropriate. Normality was tested using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Bonferroni or Dunns post-hoc analysis was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Data are shown as meanSEM (Standard Error of the Mean). Differences were considered statistically significant when P<0.05.
