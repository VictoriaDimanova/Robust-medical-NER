All patients provided informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ETC trial (NCT04177021) was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Institutional Review Board (IRB). The primary objective was to assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of treating of NY-ESO-1specific ETC. Tolerability based on CTCAE V.4.0 was the primary endpoint. Response based on RECIST V.1.1 at 810 weeks and T-cell persistence based on tetramer (tet+) staining were secondary endpoints. Eligibility included advanced or metastatic SS or MRCL with at least one prior line of therapy, expression of HLA A*0201, ECOG performance status 1 and NY-ESO-1 expression in >25% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (for complete eligibility criteria, see online supplemental figure 1). Patients were labeled Cy1Cy4 based on order of enrollment. Details regarding cell generation have been previously reported. Baseline imaging was performed approximately 2 weeks prior to infusion and an additional scan was performed 4 weeks afterwards. After their 810 week scan, patients were followed per standard of care with additional research blood collections. The patient who received ACT at the NCI (labeled NIH) consented for a blood/tissue collection protocol registered with the FHCRC IRB. The patient treated at UCLA (labeled UCLA) provided informed consent at UCLA and de-identified PBMC was analyzed at FHCRC under an IRB-approved minimal risk study.
Multicolor staining including Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) tetramers was as previously described. For cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with NY-ESO-1157165 peptide (10 µg/mL) for 1 hour followed by addition of 1 Brefeldin A (BioLegend). For intracellular markers, cells were fixed using a 1:3 ratio of fixation and permeabilization (eBioscience). Data were collected using the BD FACS Symphony and analyzed with FlowJo. See online supplemental table 1 for a full list of antibody and clones.
RNA from sorted CD8+tetramer+ (tet+) was extracted using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit. Gene-expression profiling was performed on the Affymetrix Clariom D Pico assay platform. Microarray data were normalized and analyzed by Limma. Repeated measure was applied to all patients to account for only time-dependent change. Gene sets were obtained from MSigDB Collections.
TCR V sequencing and normalization was performed on tet+ cells sorted from patients PBMCs by Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA, USA). The number of total cells, T cells, the T-cell fraction, the number of unique rearrangements and clonality were calculated for each sample as previously described. 
Serum samples were collected before infusion and at different times post-infusion, then stored at 20°C. Samples were analyzed in duplicates at the same time using a Luminex microbead assay.
Tumor specimens were cut into 12 mm fragments and cultured with 2000 U/mL IL-2 and cryopreserved. To liberate additional T cells from tumor, some frozen fragments were thawed, incubated in an enzymatic cocktail containing Type IV collagenase, DNase and hyaluronidase for 30 min at 37°C, then pressed through a 70 mm mesh cell strainer.
PBMCs (1105) from each patient were cultured in the presence of NY-ESO-1157165 peptide (10 µg/mL) and in STEMCELL-XF T expansion medium conditioned with IL-2, IL-15 and in some cases anti-PD-1. Half-media changes with conditioned media were performed on every alternate day until day 8 when PBMCs were harvested for flow cytometry. For the 3D culture assay, GFP-transduced 1765 MRCL cells were embedded in Collagen Type I in organoid chips (AIM Biotech) for coculture assays. Chips were imaged using the Leica SP8 microscope and analyzed using Imaris software (see online supplemental table 2 for information about reagents, concentrations and details regarding the 3D culture assay).
For multiple groups, statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnets multiple comparison test to compare two groups within multiple groups. For only two groups, Students t-test was applied. ****p0.0001; ***p0.001; **p0.01; *p0.05.
