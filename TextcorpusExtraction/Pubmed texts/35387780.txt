BALB/c mice were purchased from Envigo, Shanghai Lingchang Bio-Technology or Charles River and female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River or The Jackson Laboratory and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were carried out in accordance with UK home office (local) regulations and with approved institutional guidelines. Studies run at Ionis Pharmaceuticals or CrownBio were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the internal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated cages under controlled conditions of temperature (19°C23°C), humidity (55%10%), photoperiod (12 hours light/12 hours dark), air exchange with food and water provided ad libitum. All animal manipulations were conducted in a biosafety cabinet maintained under positive pressure. The Ionis Pharmaceuticals facilities have been accredited by Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
ID8-VEGF (35106cells/mouse), A20 (31051107cells/mouse), MC-38 (1107cells/mouse) tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left flank of syngeneic mice. 4T1 (1104cells/mouse) were implanted in mammary fat pads of female BALB/c mice. Twelve days before (MC-38 and 4T1) or 1day after (A20 and ID8-VEGF) implantation, mice were randomized into groups by body weight and dosed s.c. with FOXP3 ASOs 895310, 895317 or control ASO 792169 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or intrapertioneally with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) (BioXcell, RMP1-14, rat IgG2a) or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (mouse IgG1, clone D265A; AstraZeneca). Tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula based on caliper measurements of length (l) and width (w): volume=(pi/6)lw.
For downstream flow cytometric experiments, cells were liberated from tumors using a mouse tumor dissociation kit and tissue dissociator (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturers instructions.
For non-tumor bearing studies, BALB/c female mice were dosed s.c. 25 times per week with 20 or 50mg/kg FOXP3 ASOs 895310, 895317 or control ASO 792169 in PBS for 46 weeks. At the end of each week, whole blood (cardiac puncture, under terminal isoflurane anesthesia) and spleens were removed and processed for flow cytometry, the remaining carcass was submerged into 10% buffered formalin and certain tissues were processed for histological analysis.
Female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were implanted with 1107 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) per mouse (JAX). Sevendays post PBMC implantation, humanized mice were s.c. treated with indicated doses of ASOs for four consecutive days. Spleens were harvested 24 hours after the last dose and processed for RNA isolation and flow cytometry analysis.
Human CD4 cells were isolated from splenocytes of humanized PBMC mice by the combination of negative magnetic purification steps using a mouse and human EasySep CD4 T cell purification kits (Stemcell Technologies). Purified human CD4 cells were cultured in ImmunoCult-XT T cell expansion media (Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with 30ng/mL of human recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 (Stemcell Technologies). CD4 cells were treated ex vivo with oligonucleotides by free uptake in a dose-response study for 72 hours. Cells were activated for 24hours in the presence of ImmunoCult human CD3/CD28/CD2 T cell activator (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were collected and evaluated for changes in the levels of FOXP3 messenger RNA (mRNA) by RT-qPCR and levels of FOXP3 protein by flow cytometry.
All ASOs used in this study were 16 nucleotides in length, connected sequentially by phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. The three nucleotides at both the 5' and 3' ends are composed of 24 cEt-modified ribonucleotides, which confer an increased affinity to the target mRNA and increased resistance to exo and endonucleases within the cell. The central portion is composed of 10 deoxynucleotides, enabling RNase H1 to recognize and cleave the target mRNA in the ASO:RNA duplex. The sequence of the human FOXP3 lead ASO AZD8701/IONIS-1063734 was GATTTTGACATTCTGC. The sequences of the mouse FOXP3 ASOs used in this study were ION-895310 (ATATGTATAGCTGGTT), ION-895317 (GTAAATATTAGGATGG), ION-895545 (TAGCATGTAGTACAGG) and ION-895562 (TAGTTTTGGGTTGAGG). The simple letters indicate DNA and the italicized/underlined letters indicate cEt-modified RNA bases.
Error bars relate to SEM unless indicated in figure legends. Appropriate statistical testing was performed using GraphPad Prism (V.7 or V.8). Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, ****p0.0001.
