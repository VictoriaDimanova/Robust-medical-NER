The assay was carried out by transiently co-transfecting HEK293T cells with pFR-Luc reporter and pRL-CMV reporter (Promega #E2261), pCMV-BD (Stratagene #211342) containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused with full-length human RORt (Genbank accession no. NP_001001523, aa 1497), or ROR (Genbank accession no. NP_599022, aa 305556) or pCMV-BD-ROR (Genbank accession no. NP_008845, aa 201459). The transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of JNJ-61803534 for 1620 h, after which firefly luciferase signals were measured, as described previously.
Selectivity against 18 nuclear receptors was tested for JNJ-61803534 in 1-hybrid reporter assays using a similar protocol to that described earlier, or in a biochemical TR-FRET assay. 28 GPCRs were evaluated through cAMP or calcium FLIPR assays. A panel of 52 different receptors, ion channels and transporters was tested by Cerep, Inc. (Redmond, WA). Kinase selectivity was conducted by Eurofins Panlabs Inc (St Charles, MO).
Preclinical samples were provided by the Scripps Research Institute. Blood donors, both male and females, have given informed consent to participate in this study and the study protocol on human blood samples was submitted by Janssen R&D and approved by the Scripps Research Institute IRB (Institutional Review Board). All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Total CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors using a CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyl Biotec, Auburn, CA), following the manufacturers instructions. Isolated CD4+ T cells were cultured under Th17, Th1 or regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation conditions in the presence or absence of JNJ-61803534 (see supplementary materials and methods).
Frozen purified human CD4+CD25+ natural Treg cells (nTreg), monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and CD4+CD25- T effector cells (Teff) (Allcells, LLC, Alameda, CA) were thawed and co-cultured in the presence or absence of JNJ-61803534. T cell proliferation and IFN production were measured to evaluate nTreg activity (see supplementary materials and methods).
Animals were handled following the protocol approved by Janssen R&D La Jolla Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All in vivo studies were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Heparinized human, rat or mouse whole blood was collected and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (at 1:1 for human or 1:4 for rat and mouse), then stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD8 and IL-23 in the presence or absence of JNJ-61803534. Two days later, IL-17A levels were measured in culture supernatant samples (see supplementary materials and methods).
Various doses of JNJ-61803534 or vehicle were administered orally to female C57B6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, CA), and at different time points post dosing, the mice were euthanized, and blood was collected into heparinized tubes (BD Microtainer) for measurement of compound levels by LCMS analysis and ex vivo stimulated IL-17A using the whole blood assay described above.
On Day 0, mice (female DBA/1Lacj, Jackson Laboratories; 810 weeks) were immunized at the base of the tail with an emulsion containing equal amounts of Chick Type II Collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA) and Complete-Freunds adjuvant (CFA, Chondrex), 100 µg each per mouse, and administered a second immunization boost on day 21. On this day, animals were examined for clinical arthritis scores and randomized into treatment groups. JNJ-61803534 (3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg twice daily or 60 mg/kg once a day) or vehicle (20% HPCD) was given orally daily from day 21 to 34. Clinical arthritis scores were evaluated from day 21 to 34, and animals were euthanized under CO2 on day 35. Both hind paws from each animal were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology.
The backs of BALBc male mice were depilated one day prior to the start of dosing (day 0). Vehicle or JNJ-61803534 at 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg (in 20% HPCD) was orally administered twice a day on days 1 through 6, and once in the morning on day 7 with a dosing volume of 10 mL/kg. On days 2 through 6, 23 h after oral dosing of JNJ-61803534, 50 mg Aldara cream (containing 5% IMQ, Meda AB, Sweden) was applied to the back and 5 mg Aldara was applied to both ears of each mouse. For control groups, an equal amount of Balea cream (DM Drogerie Markt, Wals, Austria) was applied to both the back and ears of the mice. There was no Aldara/ Balea treatment on the final day (day 7). Disease (skin thickness, degree of skin redness and scaling) was measured prior to each morning dose and scores of 04 were assigned, with a maximum possible score of 12. On day 7, after morning dose, animals were sacrificed, and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Skin, ear, and lymph nodes were collected for gene expression or flow cytometry analysis (see supplementary materials and methods).
JNJ-61803534 was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies for 1 month duration in SpragueDawley rats and Beagle dogs. The type of study plan was reviewed and agreed by the Laboratory Animal Welfare Officer and the Animal Ethical Committee (officially known as Dierexperimentencommissie (DEC) Charles River Den Bosch), as required by the Dutch Act on Animal Experimentation (February 1997). Both rat and dog studies were performed in AALAC accredited Charles River Laboratories in the Netherlands. Studies in rats were conducted with 0, 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg per day (n=10/sex/group) for 1 month. An additional 5 animals/sex in vehicle and high dose were allowed to continue for a 1-month treatment-free recovery period. Studies in dogs were conducted with 0, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg per day (n=4/sex/group) for 1 month. A treatment-free recovery period of 1 month (additional 2 dogs/sex/group) was included for both vehicle controls and high dose groups. JNJ-61803534, as amorphous spray-dried powder containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMC-AS) LG polymer at a ratio of 3:7, was formulated as an aqueous suspension with citrate phosphate buffer (pH3.4) and 0.15% Xiameter and administered daily by gavage. Rats and dogs were examined for mortality, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopic changes, body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, anatomic pathology, and toxicokinetics. In addition, dogs were examined for electrocardiographic changes. Rats and dogs were also assessed for reversal of any effects following a 1-month recovery period. These studies were conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations.
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center study was designed by Janssen Immunology Clinical Development team and approved by Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (Comit© voor Medische Ethiek UZA, Wilrijkstraat 10, Edegem, 2650, Belgium). The study was conducted in Janssens Clinical Pharmacology Unit in Belgium from May 18th 2017 to April 5th 2018, according to Declaration of Helsinki principles and International Committee on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The trial was to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-61803534, and registered as NCT03139500 on 04/05/2017 at ClinicalTrials.gov. Participants were healthy males and females of non-childbearing potential (postmenopausal or permanently sterile), aged 18 to 60 years inclusive, with a body mass index of 18 and 30 kg/m2 and body weight of not less than 50 kg. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. No formal sample size and power calculations were performed. The number of participants chosen for this study was considered adequate to provide a preliminary safety assessment and PK assessment. The randomization was based on a computer-generated treatment randomization schedule prepared and balanced by using randomly permuted blocks. Two blocks was utilized with the first block of size 2 and randomization ratio of 1:1 and the second block of size 6 and randomization ratio of 5:1 (JNJ-61803534: placebo). Participants and study site staff members including the Investigator were blinded to treatment allocation during entire study period. JNJ-61803534 was supplied as 10 mg and 100 mg tablets, which have no visual differences from placebo tablets. Cohorts 1 to 4 received single oral doses of 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg after an overnight fast, and cohort 5 were dosed 100 mg within 30 min of the start of a standard high fat meal. Participants were randomized to JNJ-61803534 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) for cohort 1, 2 and 4, and JNJ-61803534 (n=9) or placebo (n=3) for cohorts 3 and 5. The doses of JNJ-61803534 were escalated in a stepwise fashion if the safety, tolerability, and plasma pharmacokinetic profile were deemed acceptable. For all parts of the study, adverse events and concomitant medications were assessed and recorded from screening through follow-up (day 1421 post-dose). The following safety measures were assessed at various time points during the study: medical history, physical examination, neurologic examination, electrocardiogram (12-lead ECG, or continuous telemetry), and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature). Safety measures also included clinical laboratory tests: blood chemistry; hematology, coagulation, and serology tests; urinalysis; alcohol analysis; urine pregnancy test and serum pregnancy test (females); urine drug screen; 24-h urine for creatinine clearance, protein, and albumin excretion rate. This was a Phase 1 first-in-human study with limited sample size, the data generated was descriptive in nature, and no formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. Although there was no formal interim analysis, assessments of PK and PD samples by cohort and safety assessments were conducted and reviewed during the study to plan dose-escalation and future development.
For all parts of the clinical study, venous blood samples were taken for the measurement of JNJ-61803534 plasma concentrations at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 216, 312, 408, 504, 672, 840, 1008, and 1176 h post-dose. Plasma samples with K2EDTA anticoagulant were treated with acetonitrile for protein extraction then processed with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Reversed-phase HPLC separation was used and tandem MS/MS detection was set in TIS positive mode. A stable labeled analyte was used as internal standard to determine concentrations of JNJ-61803534 and the lowest limit of quantification was 1 ng/ml. All the data reported in sample analysis and validation met the predefined acceptance criteria and fulfilled the requirements and recommendations in the current FDA guidance for bioanalytical method validations and analysis.
Whole blood samples were collected on the morning of day 1 at pre-dose and at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 120 h post-dose in Cohorts 1 and 2. For Cohort 3,4, and 5, samples were collected the morning of day 1 at pre-dose and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 120, 312 and 504 h post-dose. Blood samples (1 ml) were drawn into TruCulture tubes (Myriad RBM, Austin, TX) which contained 2 ml of cocktail containing cell culture media and stimulants, then mixed and incubated at 37 C in a block thermostat for 48 h. The final concentrations of the stimulants in the TruCulture tube incubations were: IL-23 (50 ng/ml), and IL-1 (10 ng/ml), with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies at standard concentration as per standard CD3/CD28 TruCulture tubes. Negative control tubes (no stimulants) were also collected at each timepoint. Supernatants were collected after the end of the incubation period and analyzed to determine concentrations of induced IL-17A using a validated immunoassay method (human IL-17A V-plex kit from Meso Scale Discovery).
