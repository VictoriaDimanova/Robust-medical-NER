In total, 112 UC patients were analysed across all experiments. In some patients, intestinal tissue as well as blood samples were taken for analysis. Intestinal biopsies or gut specimens from UC patients [n = 83; 45 female, 2371 years and 38 male, 1974 years] were used for cell culture [n = 70] or RNA isolation [n = 13] studies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] were isolated from blood of 47 UC patients [24 female, 2456 years; 23 male, 2259 years] and from buffy coats of nine healthy donors.
In addition to above described non-cobitolimod-treated UC patients, histological slides of colon biopsies were obtained from UC patients who had participated in the placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized multi-centre clinical study CSUC-01/10 [NCT01493960], where the efficacy and safety of cobitolimod was assessed. In this clinical trial, 131 UC patients with treatment-refractory UC were included with active clinical [Clinical Activity Index score ¥ 9] and endoscopic [Mayo endoscopic subscore > 1] disease. Cobitolimod [30 mg] was administered on weeks 0 and 4 proximal to the site of the most severe inflamation or, in the case of pancolitis, in the transverse colon via topical endoscopic application. Biopsies were taken from the area of most severe endoscopic inflammation at week 0 and in the same area again at week 4. Histological slides of colon biopsies from baseline [week 0] and week 4 were obtained from placebo- [n = 4] and cobitolimod-treated patients responding [n = 7] or not responding [n = 6] to cobitolimod treatment [see Figure 8]. The placebo patients had an unchanged endoscopic Mayo subscore [¥ 2] at weeks 0 and 4, and did therefore not respond endoscopically to placebo treatment. The cobitolimod patients were endoscopic responders to cobitolimod application at baseline, as they demonstrated endoscopic response [endoscopic Mayo subscore of 0 or 1] in the follow-up endoscopy at week 4. Samples were included in the study after obtaining prior written informed consent from each patient, and sample collection was previously approved by the ethical committee and the institutional review board of the University of Erlangen-Nrnberg.
A pathologist blinded to all clinical and endoscopic data of the respective patient performed histological classification of the intestinal biopsies from UC patients [Figure 1A]. Severity of inflammation was determined by histopathological grading that included absent [score 0], mild [score 1], moderate [score 2] and severe [score 3] inflammation. The currently available validated histopathological scores for UC [Nancy-Index and Robarts Histopathology Index] were not used for evaluation by the pathologist. The endoscopic Mayo score was used for the assessment of the severity of endoscopic inflammation in the examined UC patients. The partial Mayo score was used for the assessment of the clinical disease activity of the UC patients at the time of endoscopic examination. The clinical, endoscopic and histological activity scores of the UC patients from Figure 1A are depicted in Supplementary Table 1.
Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Research Models and Services. TLR9 knockout mice were originally obtained from Hermann Wagner and kindly provided by Thomas Winkler. Eight-week-old female Balb/c mice were used for the experiments and were kept in individually ventilated cages in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Water and food were available ad libitum. Mice were randomly mixed per cage before initiation of the experiment to ensure comparable experimental conditions. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with German laws for the protection of animals, after approval by the animal welfare committee [Regierung von Unterfranken].
For DSS-induced colitis, 3% [w/v] DSS [MP Biomedicals] was added to the drinking water of 8-week-old female Balb/c mice for 10 days. An additional control group of three mice which were not given DSS [untreated] was also part of the experimental set up.
Groups of seven mice were rectally administered with 40, 84 or 250 µg cobitolimod on days 4 and 8. The respective concentration of cobitolimod was diluted with sterile water and 100 µL was used for rectal administration per mouse. Mice in the placebo group [n = 7] were treated with 100 µL sterile water only. The three mice from the untreated group [no DSS] were not given cobitolimod or water rectally.
Food uptake and body weight were monitored on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. The Disease Activity Index [DAI] is the combined score of body weight loss compared to initial body weight, stool consistency and visible blood in faeces. The maximum score per mouse is 12. DAI was assessed on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. In addition, colonic inflammation was studied in vivo using the Coloview endoscopic system consisting of a miniature endoscope [scope 1.9 mm outer diameter], a xenon light source, a triple chip camera and an air pump [all from Karl Storz] to achieve regulated inflation of the mouse colon. For endoscopy, mice were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a rate of 0.20.5 L/min [2% isoflurane was used for maintenance]. The modified murine endoscopic score of colitis severity [MEICS] were used to determine endoscopic signs of inflammation. The endoscopic colitis grading [MEICS score] consists of the following five parameters: thickening of the colon, change of the normal vascular pattern, presence of fibrin, mucosal granularity and stool consistency. Endoscopic grading was performed for each parameter [score 03] leading to an accumulative score between 0 and 15. Endoscopic grading was analysed on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Histological severity of inflammation was assessed by histopathological analysis of intestinal sections. The histological score encompassed 0 = no inflammation, 1 = remission, 2 = mild inflammation, 3 = moderate inflammation and 4 = severe inflammation.
For quantitative real-time PCR [qRT-PCR] RNA was isolated from intestinal biopsies of mice treated with DSS or from UC patients using the Nucleo Spin II kit [Macherey-Nagel]. In total, 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA [iScript, BioRad] according to the manufacturers instructions. For quantitative expression analysis, quantitect primers [Qiagen] were used. Data were normalized to the housekeeping-gene HPRT.
Intestinal biopsies were taken from DSS-induced colitis mice that were treated with placebo [n = 4] or cobitolimod [n = 4] as mentioned above. Lamina propria mononuclear cells [LPMCs] were isolated and RNA was extracted. Its integrity was verified using a Nano Chip [RNA 6000; Agilent Technologies] on a BioAnalyzer [vB.02.03 BSI307; 2100; Agilent Technologies] as recommended by the manufacturers protocol [RNA 6000 Nano Assay Protocol2]. Sample labelling and preparation for microarray hybridization was performed according to a standard protocol. The RNA replicates of four placebo and four cobitolimod-treated mice in DSS colitis were each hybridized onto a 4  44k array [design-ID 026655; Agilent Technologies]. Data were extracted with the feature extraction software package [v.11.7.1; Agilent Technologies] using a standard protocol. The text files generated by the feature extraction software were imported into GeneSpring GX [v.12.5; Silicon Genetics]. Data were log2-transformed followed by normalization to the 75th percentile and corrected to the median of all samples. Features passing the quality check [flags detected in at least one condition] and showing changes in expression levels equal to or greater than two-fold were selected for further analysis. A volcano plot was applied to identify statistically significant [p > 0.05], more than two-fold differentially expressed genes, between two conditions, including the BenjaminiHochberg multiple test correction. Pearson and Ward analyses were used to generate hierarchical clustering of the experimental conditions [placebo or cobitolimod-treated mice in DSS-induced colitis]. The heatmap depicts genes that have been described in the literature to be susceptible regarding DSS-induced colitis.
Cryo-frozen intestinal cross sections from patient colonic biopsies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using the TSA plus kit [Perkin Elmer] according to the manufacturers instructions. Alternatively, slides were fixed with methanol at 20°C for 10 min, blocked with 10% fetal calf serum [FCS]/1% bvine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody. Paraffin-embedded tissues were deparaffinized and antigen unmasking was performed using citrate buffer. Thereafter slides were incubated with different antibodies.
For DSS-induced colitis mice, immunofluorescence analysis was performed in intestinal sections, which were taken at the end of the experiment on day 10 for IL10 [Abcam], IL17 [Abcam] and Foxp3 [eBioscience]. Colon biopsies of UC patients were taken before and 28 days after topical cobitolimod or placebo treatment and the corresponding cross sections were stained for IL10 [Abcam], FoxP3 [eBioscience] or IL17 [Abcam]. From each sample, four to six high power fields [HPFs] per patient were analysed using a 10 objective magnification. Analysis of images was done with a fluorescence microscope [BZ-8100 or BZ-9000, Keyence] or a confocal microscope [LSM, Leica Microsystems] and calculated with ImageJ 1.52a [NIH]
Blood from UC patients [n = 47] or controls [n = 9] was collected and PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. LPMCs from intestinal biopsies or gut specimens [n = 83] were isolated using the lamina propria kit [Miltenyi Biotec] as previously described. CD4+or CD14+cells were isolated with magnetic beads according to the manufacturers instructions [Miltenyi Biotec].
Human or murine LPMCs from gut specimens or biopsies were isolated using the lamina propria kit [Miltenyi Biotec]. Cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 GlutaMax [Gibco] supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin/streptavidin [Gibco], 10% FCS [Sigma-Aldrich] and gentamycin [Gibco]. LPMCs were stimulated for 24, 48 or 72 h with 1 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide [LPS; Sigma-Aldrich], 1 µg/mL LPS in combination with 100 µM cobitolimod [InDex Pharmaceuticals], 1 µg/mL LPS and anti-IL10 [abcam] or 1 µg/mL LPS and anti-IL17 [abcam]. Stimulated cells were used for flow cytometry analysis, RNA from stimulated LPMCs was isolated and analysed via qRT-PCR, supernatants were collected and analysed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA].
In another setting, PBMCs from buffy coats of healthy donors were isolated and 2  106 cells per well were seeded in 400 µL RPMI complete medium. Directly after seeding, cobitolimod or cobitolimod with GpC instead of CpG motif was added so that the final concentration in the well reached 0.1, 1 or 10 µM. Cell supernatants were harvested after 48 h of incubation and were used for cytokine measurement by CBA kits [BD], followed by analysis using FCAP Array software from BD according to the manufacturers instructions. Isolated splenocytes from wildtype or TLR9 knock-out mice were untreated or treated for 48 h with 1, 10 or 100 µM cobitolimod. Release of IL10 was determined by ELISA.
PBMCs from UC patients were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. CD14+PBMCs were isolated with magnetic beads according to the manufacturers instructions [Miltenyi Biotec]. In total, 1  106 CD14+cells per 24-well were cultured for 8 days either with 100 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF; R&D], 100 ng/mL LPS and 20 ng/mL IFN or in combination with 25 µM cobitolimod to generate pro-inflammatory macrophages. For wound healing macrophages, 1  106 CD14+cells per well were cultured for 8 days with either 100 ng/mL M-CSF and 20 ng/mL IL4 or in combination with 25 µM cobitolimod. After 8 days in culture, in vitro generated pro-inflammatory and wound healing macrophages were analysed via flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.
PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors using density gradient centrifugation according to standard procedures. Cells were seeded onto a 96-well culture at 5  105 cells per well in complete RPMI [cRPMI] supplemented with 25 mg/mL gentamicin, 5 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 5 mM Hepes and 10% [v/v] heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were pre-incubated for 45 min either with medium alone or with 1, 10 or 50 µg/mL chloroquine at 37°C. Cobitolimod was then diluted with cRPMI and added to the well [100 µM per well]. Cells containing medium alone or cobitolimod alone [without chloroquine pre-incubation] were used as a control. Cells were incubated for 48 h and supernatants were used for cytokine measurements either via Luminex or CBA kits, followed by analysis with FCAP Array software according to the manufacturers instructions.
The interaction between cobitolimod as a CpG-ODN and human TLR9 and their kinetics were studied in vitro using the Attana A200 system. The Attana A200 is a dual-channel, continuous-flow system for automated analysis based on the Quartz Crystal Microbalance [QCM] technology. The two sensor channels are referred to as channels A and B, where A is used for monitoring of the molecular interaction and B serves as a reference. Proteoliposomes with TLR9 or protein mock control were immobilized by adsorption on polystyrene [PS] surfaces. A final protein concentration of 250 µg/mL was diluted into PS buffer [5 mM acetic acid pH 5, 50 mM NaCl]. The solution was incubated over the PS surfaces for 3 h at room temperature. Equal volume of liposomes were used to prepare the protein mock control surfaces. The chips were docked in the instrument with the flow set at 100 µL/min for 10 min. After reducing the flow to 20 µL/min, running buffer was passed over the surfaces until stabilization of the baseline [frequency change  0.2 Hz over 600 s]. Cobitolimod was injected in duplicates at different concentrations: 200, 100, 50 or 25 µg/mL. The experiment was performed at a flow rate of 20 µL/min. Samples were injected for 60 s and the dissociation was followed for 180 s. Sensograms were collected using Attester software [Attana AB] and analysed with Evaluation software [Attana AB] and TraceDrawer [Ridgeview]. The sensograms obtained from channel A were subtracted from the signal obtained from the reference surface in channel B. To calculate the kinetic parameters [ka and kd] and affinity constant [KD], the experimental data were fitted using a 1:1 model. In a 1:1 model, the curve fitting describes the interaction between a monovalent analyte that binds the target on a single site. The fit generates an association rate constant (ka [1/M·s]), a dissociation rate constant [kd [1/s]] and an affinity constant [KD [M]] calculated as the ratio ka/kd.
An ELISA was performed using IFN, TNF, IL1, IL6, IL17, TGF, IL4 and IL10 ELISA kits [eBioscience] according to the manufacturers instructions.
For different experiments, LPMCs were isolated from intestinal biopsies of mice treated with DSS or from the colon of UC patients and cultured as described above. Prior to intracellular staining, cells were treated with a stimulation cocktail containing phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate [PMA], Golgi-Stop and Ionomycin [eBioscience] for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using a transcription factor buffer set [BD Biosciences] according to the manufacturers instructions. Cells were stained for CD4 [BD Pharmingen], Tbet [Biolegend], IFN [BD Pharmingen], GATA3 [BD Pharmingen], IL4 [Biolegend], IL17A [Biolegend], RorT [BD Pharmingen] and respective isotype controls. For other experiments cells were stained with CD4 [Biolegend], CD8 [Biolegend], CD14 [BD Pharmingen], CD15 [Biolegend], CD19 [BD Pharmingen], CD11c [BD Pharmingen], NK1.1 [Biolegend], CD68 [BD Pharmingen], CD80 [Biolegend], CD163 [Biolegend], CD206 [BD Pharmingen], CD25 [BD Pharmingen], FoxP3 [BD Pharmingen], CD49b [Biolegend], LAG3 [Biolegend] and IL10 [Biolegend]. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with FACS Calibur [BD Biosciences]. Cells were analysed using the FlowJo single cell analysis software [v.10.1r5, TreeStar].
Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism [Graph Pad Software]. After testing for normal distribution with the ShapiroWilk normality test, significant differences between samples were calculated using the unpaired Students t test or the Mann-Whitney U-rank test [*p  0.05; **p  0.01; ***p  0.001].
