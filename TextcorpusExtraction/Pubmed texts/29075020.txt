Protein separation, in-gel trypsin cleavage and mass spectrometry analysis were carried out as described. Peptide separation was performed using an EASY-nLC 1000 UHPLC (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a 75 µmX 2cm Acclaim PepMap 100 pre-column with nanoViper fittings and a 50µm I.D.500mm Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical column (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted using a 5%-30% acetonitrile gradient for 60min. at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The Q-Exactive instrument acquisition mode was set to the top 10 MS2 method. The survey scans were taken at 70,000FWHM (at m/z 400) resolving power in positive mode and using a target of 1e6 and default charge state of+2. Unassigned and+1 charge states were rejected, and dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30sec. The scan range was set to m/z 3001600m/z. For MS/MS, a microscan was obtained at 17,500FWHM and with an isolation window of 3.0 m/z, using a scan range between m/z 2002000m/z. Tandem mass spectra were processed with the Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software v 1.3. Spectra were searched against UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot mouse databases (version 09/2015) using the SEQUEST HT algorithm (v1.3.0.339). The search was performed choosing trypsin as the cleaving enzyme with one missed cleavage site allowed. Precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was 0.1Da. N-terminal acetylation, cysteine carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Peptide identification was performed with the Percolator algorithm by selecting only peptides with a q-value<0.01, which corresponds to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.
