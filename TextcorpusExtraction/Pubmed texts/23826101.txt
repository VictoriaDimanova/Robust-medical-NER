This prospective clinical investigation followed Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all patients provided written informed consent prior to enrolment. The study was approved by the IRB of the Medical University of Vienna and was conducted in Austria. The clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients had to have histologically proven invasive breast cancer stage I-III, and the presence of distant metastasis as evaluated by chest x-ray, liver sonography and bone scan had to be ruled out prior to study entry. All patients received three cycles of epirubicin 75 mg/m2 IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (1-hour IV infusion) on day 1 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 µg/kg/d subcutaneously on days 3 to 10 (filgrastim, Neupogen; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA).
Tumor diameter were measured by ultrasound before systemic therapy and immediately prior to curative surgery, and clinical responses were evaluated according to RECIST criteria. A reduction in the longest tumor diameter of >30% was required for classifying a tumor as responsive. Pre-treatment tumor samples were obtained by three to six 14-gauge core needle biopsies, and were equally split in three portions: one portion was used for histological confirmation of invasive breast cancer and for evaluation of Ki67 protein expression by IHC. The second portion was subjected to ATP-TCA, while the third portion was immediately snap-frozen in dry ice for gene expression profiling. Post-treatment tumor samples for Ki67 determination were obtained during curative surgery, which was performed within 2 to 4 weeks after the last scheduled chemotherapy cycle. Tumors which had a decrease in Ki67 expression of >30% in response to Epi/Doc were considered sensitive. The procedural flow is shown in figure 1.
Primary human breast cancer cells were isolated from pre-treatment tumor samples, and ATP-TCA was performed as previously described. In brief, 10 00020 000 tumor cells per well were seeded in tumor cell-supporting growth medium in 96-well microtiter plates. Epirubicin and Docetaxel were used in combination at test drug concentrations (TDCs) of 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25% (with 100% TDC corresponding to peak plasma concentrations). All tests were performed in triplicates. Tumor cells were lysed after 7 days of incubation and the amount of cellular ATP was determined with a luciferin/luciferase reaction. Cell preparation and ATP-TCA were performed using commercially available reagents (TCA-100, DCS, Hamburg, Germany). Luminescence was measured with either a LB953 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) or a MPL2 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Chemosensitivity across the tested concentration range was evaluated by using the Sensitivity Index (SI). The SI is obtained by measuring the area under the inhibition curve for multiple dilutions of the effective chemotherapy dose. A low SI indicates good chemosensitivity to a particular antineoplastic compound in vitro, while a high SI value describes poor chemosensitivity.
RNA extraction, amplification and GeneChip hybridization was performed according to the manufactureÅs protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). In brief, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from one patient by a chimeric oligonucleotide with an oligo-dT and a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at a concentration of 100 pmol/µl. Reverse transcription was performed as recommended by Affymetrix by using commercially available reagents (Invitrogen). The reaction products were cleaned by phenol-chloroform extraction before biotin-labelling and an approximately 250-fold amplification were performed. 10 µg of each of the 6 labelled cRNA samples was then hybridized onto a separate Affymetrix U133 GeneChip Set. The set consists of two GeneChip arrays and contains almost 45,000 probe sets representing more than 39,000 transcripts derived from approximately 33,000 well-substantiated human genes. The set design uses sequences selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Prehybridization, hybridization, washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin were carried out according to the manufactureÅs protocol. Antibody amplification was accomplished using a biotin-linked antistreptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Buringame, CA). The goat immunoglobulin G-blocking (Sigma, St Louis, MO) antibody was used for blocking unspecific binding. The arrays were then stained and washed as recommendet by Affymetrix, before being scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The gene expression data presented in our manuscript have been deposited in a publicly available data base (Gene Expression Omnibus) and can be accessed under the following weblink: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29561.
Microarray data were preprocessed using quantile normalization and RMA. In order to test the null hyothesis of no differential expression between tumors that showed considerable size reduction after treatment and those that did not, for each gene Welchs two sample t-test was computed. Marginal p-values were adjusted using methods previously described in order to provide control over the local false discovery rate (locFDR). A cut-off of 0.15 was considered to achieve similar control as conventional.05 -levels when using the false discovery rate. For the sake of exploration, genes with a locFDR of up to.25 were considered. All computations were implemented using R (http://cran.r-project.org) and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).
