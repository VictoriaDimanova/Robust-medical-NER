Caco-2/TC7 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Monique Rousset, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France, and were routinely cultured at a density of 1.6  104 cells/ cm2 in T75 cell culture flasks in glucose-free DMEM medium, 2% (v/v) Glutamax (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with either 25 mM glucose or 25 mM sucrose, 20% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 2% (v/v) non-essential amino acids and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 10% CO2 and sub-cultured by detaching with 0.25% trypsin at 80% confluence after 3 d. Cells were seeded at 6.4  104 cells/ cm2 on solid or Transwell supports and allowed to fully differentiate for 21 d (Corning, N., USA). 
OLE (Olecol in capsules and Bonolive as a loose powder) was kindly supplied by BioActor B.V. (Maastricht, The Netherlands) containing 19.8  0.5% and 41.8  0.9% (w/w) of oleuropein respectively. For chronic OLE treatment, cells were exposed to OLE as Bonolive for the final 3 d of differentiation (days 1820) and the assay(s) were conducted on day 21. Time course and concentration response experiments were prepared as detailed in figure legends. Other components in the OLE were inert excipients added for encapsulation. By HPLC, Bonolive powder also contained low amounts of tyrosol (0.045% w/w) and hydroxytyrosol (0.0065% w/w) as previously reported. Caco-2/TC7 cell viability was determined for experiments after 3-day treatment with OLE at 1.5 mg/mL. Cells were seeded on 12-well solid supports and maintained and treated as previously described. Viability was determined using the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit Roche, Burgess Hill, UK according to the manufacturers protocol. No significant loss of viability was observed (n = 9 replicates).
Differentiated cells in 75 cm2 flasks were washed 3 times with cold PBS and scraped into 1 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, bestatin hydrochloride, N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-L-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide, leupeptin hemisulfate salt, and pepstatin A as protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysates were snap frozen and stored at 80 °C until required. On the day of the assay, cell lysates were thawed, vortexed and then passed 1015 times though a 21G needle syringe. After protein determination, the lysate was diluted in assay buffer as required. Assay samples of 250 µL were used containing 0.02 units of sucrase activity; where 1 unit is the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 µmol of product per min. An incubation time of 10 min was used to fall within the linear range of product with 10 mM sucrose as substrate. To determine the specific activity, four concentrations of enzyme were tested. The product glucose concentration was determined using a hexokinase assay. The assay has been as described in full previously. Absorbance measurements were performed on a Pherastar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany).
Caco-2/TC7 cells were seeded on 6-well culture plates and grown as described in 2.1 and treated with OLE as described in 2.2. On day 21, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and total RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA content was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm on a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cDNA was synthesised from 250 ng of total RNA using the GoScript Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The QX100 Droplet Digital PCR system (ddPCR; Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) was used to quantify changes in gene expression of SI, GLUT2, GLUT5, SGLT1 and CDX2 from n = 9 replicates. Each assay (20 µL) consisted of cDNA template (2.5 ng for SI, CDX2 or 5 ng for GLUT2, GLUT5 and SGLT1), 1 µL of FAM-labelled Taqman primer for each gene of interest, 1 µL of VIC-labelled Taqman primer for TBP (TATA-box binding protein, housekeeping gene) and 10 µL of ddPCR Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The Taqman primers were from Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Hs00356112_m1 (SI), Hs01096905_m1 (GLUT2) Hs01086390_m1 (GLUT5), Hs01573790_m1 (SGLT1), Hs01078080_m1 (CDX2) and Hs00936234_m1 (TBP). Droplets were prepared with a QX100 droplet generator and then transferred to a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Droplet containing mixtures were analysed on a QX100 droplet reader using the Quantasoft software (KoÅ¡ice, Slovakia) to determine concentrations of the target DNA in copies per µl from the fraction of positive reactions using Poisson distribution analysis. Data were collected independently for each target and TBP and are presented as the ratio between target and TBP gene copies/µL. Each individual cDNA sample was analysed with technical triplicates.
Cell surface proteins were labelled with a sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin reagent using a protein labelling kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed three times with PBS containing calcium and magnesium (PBS+) and 1 mL of biotinylation reagent (0.25 mg/mL) was added to the apical side of the filter and 1.5 mL of PBS+ to the basolateral side. The plate was gently rotated on ice at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of quenching buffer to the apical side and 100 µL to the basolateral side then rotating for 5 min at 4 °C. The wells were washed twice with 150 mM sodium chloride and 20 mM Trizma base, pH 7.4 and lysed with 0.5 mL of lysis buffer containing 60 mM octyl -D-glucopyranoside, 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 0.5% protease inhibitor cocktail. The lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and kept on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing before centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and saved, and a fraction containing 0.3 mg of protein (measured by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay) in 250 µL lysis buffer was added to 50 µL of streptavidin agarose resin slurry that was pre-washed with PBS+ and rotated for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was then washed, and the bound surface proteins were eluted by the addition of 40 µL of 50 mM dithiothreitol in 50% (v/v) NuPage LDS sample buffer and 50% (v/v) MilliQ water with heating for 15 min at 37 °C. Both the total cell lysate and fraction containing purified cell surface proteins were analysed for SI protein content using the 66440 kDa separation module on an automated capillary western blotting system (WES ProteinSimple, Bio-Techne, UK) according to the manufacturers protocol. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C. The primary antibody for SI (HBB2/614/88-s, deposited by Hauri, H.-P. in Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa, USA) and the loading control -actinin (MAB8279, R&D Systems, Bio-Techne, UK) were analysed in the same capillary following optimisation. A total protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was used for cell lysate samples and a 5-fold dilution of cell surface fractions in order to fall within the established analytical linear range. Selected samples were also digested with rapid PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) according to the manufacturers instructions and 5.6 µL of the digestion product was added to 1.2 µL of WES master mix and analysed for SI and -actinin as described.
Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured on 12-well transwell plates for 21 days, washed three times with warm transport buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 137 mM sodium chloride, 2.4 mM calcium chloride and 26.8 mM of sodium bicarbonate at pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in transport buffer for 30 min. The trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) was measured using a Millipore Millicell Voltohmmeter (Merck Millipore, UK) at three places per well. TEER values greater than 200 M© indicated tight Caco-2/TC7 monolayer formation. For transport experiments, 1 mL of transport buffer was added to the basolateral side and 0.5 mL of transport solution containing glucose or sucrose, at concentrations stated in the figure legends, was added to the apical side. Samples were incubated for the specified time at 37 °C, 10% CO2. The apical and basolateral solutions were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and stored at 80 °C until analysis. During the transport assay, OLE was absent, irrespective of whether the cells had been previously treated with OLE or control.
The glucose and fructose content in the apical and basolateral sides after transport experiments were quantified by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) using an ICS4000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as previously described.
A 3-week randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was performed. Each participant completed two seven-day treatment periods (placebo and OLE) with a week of washout in-between. The study was approved by the University of Leeds, Faculties of Mathematics and Physical Sciences and Engineering Ethics Committee (MEEC15-044). Written consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted between October and December 2017. To clarify, this study was separate from the study we have published previously where the OLE treatment was given acutely together with the sucrose dose. Here, the OLE was given for 1 week, and then the sucrose was given alone without the OLE, to test for indirect effects of the OLE on e.g. gene expression, SI brush border activity and protein in vivo.
Eleven female volunteers aged between 1865 year, BMI 2025 kg/m2, non-diabetic, not pregnant or lactating, not on a special diet, and not on medication, were recruited within the campus of the University of Leeds. The suitability of volunteers was evaluated by a pre-study questionnaire and a preliminary session, where volunteers were required to arrive fasted overnight and for at least 10 h. The fasting blood glucose of volunteers was measured before 10 am, and participation was eligible for volunteers with fasting blood glucose levels between 4.0 and 5.9 mmol/L. Blood glucose was analysed using an Accu-Chek Aviva blood glucose meter as previously described. Subjects were randomised to placebo (control) or OLE capsules and assigned a code each. All data was stored in anonymised form and responses were unblinded at the end of the study by an external party. Capsules given to participants contained 380 mg maltodextrin per capsule (placebo) or 250 mg olecol (19.8  0.5% oleuropein, equivalent to ~50 mg oleuropein) with 130 mg maltodextrin (OLE). Both placebo and OLE capsules were identical in appearance, size, and weight, and odourless. The participants were instructed to take three capsules per day, each with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Participants were advised to retain their normal dietary habits, but were asked to consume the same identical evening meal before each measurement visit, with no olives or other olive-containing foods allowed during the study period. The final capsule of each treatment was consumed at 7 pm on the day before the visit. Participants arrived at the School of Food Science and Nutrition (University of Leeds) before 10 am in a fasted state (overnight fast of 1012 h) for the 2 visits, and each visit lasted ~3 h. During the fasting period only water was allowed. At each visit, participants consumed a sucrose solution, prepared by dissolving 25 g white sugar in 100 mL water. Blood glucose was measured as above at 8 time points following a baseline measurement (time 0, pre-administration of sucrose solution), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min.
Transport experiments, gene expression analysis and enzyme assays were performed using 3 independent biological replicates with 3-6 technical replicates per biological replicate. The results were normalised for each experiment by dividing all values within the experiment by the mean of the glucose control in that experiment. The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were determined from the normalised results of all experiments. Each gene expression sample was analysed in triplicate as per manufacturers recommendation. For protein analysis, two independent biological replicates with six technical replicates each were performed, and each individual sample was analysed on WES in duplicate. All results are presented as mean values from all replicates after normalisation and the error bars indicate the SEM. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukeys post-hoc test for statistical significant (p < 0.05) was performed using SPSS (v24, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). For the human study, a two-tailed Students t-test was used to assess changes between the placebo and OLE and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data are presented as mean  standard deviation, unless otherwise specified.
