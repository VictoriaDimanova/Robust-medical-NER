All patients samples were collected before chemotherapy in Beijing Tongren Hospital from patients who had given consent. The first batch was collected from June, 2013 to February, 2014. The second batch was collected from January, 2015 to June, 2015. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital, and all experiments were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the same Ethics Committee. All patients were diagnosed with advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma before surgery or treatment. Patient samples were collected by biopsy. Fresh samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C until RNA extraction.
Patients were treated with TPF chemotherapy. The treatment procedure was as described previously. Briefly, we performed three 21-day cycles of induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (75mg/m2 continuous i.v. infusion for more than 3h on day 1), cisplatin (30mg/m2), and 5-FU (500mg/m2). We chose 29 samples for our studies, i.e., 16 patients that responded well to TPF chemotherapy and 13 patients that ranged from no response to poor response to TPF treatment. These samples were then divided into two groups based on the new Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The first group had 12 sensitive patients and nine non-sensitive patients. The second group had four sensitive patients and four non-sensitive patients. All patients information is summarized in Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1. The patients gender, age, primary site, TNM, stage, cycle of chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, gastrointestinal reaction, myelosuppression efficacy, family history, precancerosis, gastroesophageal reflux, smoking history, and alcohol intake were included in our study.
In total, 16 TPF-sensitive patient samples and 13 TPF non-sensitive patient samples were chosen for microarray study. RNA was extracted from the samples by Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Gene expression profiles were then analyzed by microarray (Chip type Human-HT-12-V4, illumina).
The microarray data from the CEL files were normalized using RMA. We used the genes that were significantly differentially expressed (DEs) in the TPF-sensitive group or in the TPF non-sensitive group as features to construct the prediction model. Because our sample size was small, to robustly estimate our model and pick up the DEs as much as possible, we built an iterative one-leave-out process. We removed one patient from the first batch of data, and inferred the DEs based on the remaining data. The expression levels of these DEs were used to construct the prediction model (SVM). We then predicted the group of leave-out patients. We repeated the two steps until all 21 patients in the first batch had been removed once. So, we could obtain the average of the sensitivity and specificity based on the first batch of data alone. Here, we used the limma package to find the DEs and the required p-value<0.01. Then, we collected all DEs from the 21 rounds, and totally, we obtained 722 genes. All genes were listed as Supplemental Table 2. To avoid false-positive genes, based on our clinical knowledge, we selected 10 genes that are known to relate to TPF or be potentially involved in the treatment pathway. The expression levels of the selected genes in the first batch of data were used to train the support vector machine model and predict the group of patients in the second batch of data independently.
We used two values to estimate the performance of the predictive model based on the new data: Sensitivity: True Positive/(True Positive+False Negative); Specificity: True Negative/(True Negative+False Positive). Here, positive means that the individual patient is sensitive to the treatment; negative means that the individual patient is not sensitive to the treatment. With the first-round data, we applied the one-leave-out cross validation method to estimate the performance of the SVM model. For the second-round data, we trained SVM using the first-round data with all 21 samples, and calculated the sensitivity and specificity.
Thirty TPF-sensitive patient samples and 30 TPF non-sensitive hypopharyngeal carcinoma patient samples were collected in Beijing Tongren Hospital with patients permission. IHC was performed on 4-µm sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human hypopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval. After incubation with blocking solution, sections were incubated with anti-CXCR1 antibody (Abcam) or ARID3B antibody (Abcam) for 1h, biotinylated secondary antibody for 30min, and then streptavidin horseradish peroxidase for another 10min. Sections were developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine chromogen and further stained with hematoxylin. An H-score was assigned to each tissue based on the product of staining intensity ((), no staining; (+), weak; (++), moderate; and (+++), strong) and the percentage of stained cells (00%, 11% to 30%, 231% to 70%, and 371% to 100%).
The data are presented as mean valuesstandard deviation (SD) and statistically compared between groups using one-way analysis of variance followed by Students t-test. The significance of the variables was tested using a multivariate Coxs regression model and a logistic regression model. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
