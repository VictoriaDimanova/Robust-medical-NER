The BCN02 clinical trial (NCT02616874) was a phase I, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in Spain. The study was approved by the institutional ethical review board of the participating institutions (Reference Nr AC-15-108-R) and by the Spanish Regulatory Authorities (EudraCT 2015-002300-84) and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and local personal data protection law (LOPD 15/1999). Fifteen participants were immunized with MVA.HIVconsv (MVA1, 2  108 pfu intramuscularly), followed by three weekly-doses of romidepsin (RMD123, 5 mg/m2 body-surface area; BSA) and a second MVA.HIVconsv boost vaccination (MVA2, 2  108 pfu i.m.) before undergoing a monitored antiretroviral pause (MAP) 8 weeks later and for a maximum of 32 weeks. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stored before, at the end and after 8, 24 h (only for RMD1), and 3 and 7 days after all RMD doses for immunological and virological studies.
PBMC viability was measured using a Pacific Blue¢ Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with 7-AAD (BioLegend). Lineage surface markers (CD3, CD4, and CD8) and activation markers (HLA-DR, CD25, and CD69) were included in the staining.
Briefly, 1  106 of isolated PBMC were washed in PBS with 1% FBS and resuspend in 100 l of surface staining solution (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD69, HLA-DR) and incubated for 20 min. After 2 washes with 300 l of PBS with 1% FBS, cells were resuspended in 100 l of Annexin V Binding Buffer with the corresponding Annexin V and 7-AAD. After 15 min of incubation, 250 l of Binding Buffer was added to each tube and acquired on a LSRII BD cytometer. The percentages of apoptotic and live cells were analyzed using FlowJo software. The gating strategy is summarized in Supplementary Figure 1.
PBMCs were thawed and stimulated with anti-CD49d and anti-CD28 antibodies (BD) in presence/absence of three peptides pools (containing 58, 54, and 54 peptides) covering the HIVconsv immunogen protein in the presence of GolgiStop for 5 h. Cultures were then stored overnight at 4°C until staining. Cells were stained first with a viability stain (Aqua Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit, Invitrogen), followed by T cell lineage and maduration/activation markers (using anti-CD3-APC Cy7, anti-CD4 PECy5; anti-CD8 PerCP, anti-CCR7 B711, anti-CD45RA BV785, anti-HLA-DR BV650, anti-PD-1 BV605, anti-CD69 APC, and anti-CD25 PEDazzle594 chromogen-conjugated monoclonal antiobodies; BioLegend) and dump channel (using anti-CD19-V450 for B-cells and anti-CD14-V450 mAbs for monocytes; BioLegend) surface staining. Following the fixation and permeabilization step (Fix and Perm kit, Invitrogen), intracellular staining with conjugated antibodies specific for cytokines (IFN- A700; Invitrogen, IL-2 PECy7, TNF- FITC; BiolLegend and MIP1- PE; RD Systems) was performed. Approximately 105 cells were acquired on an LSRFortessa BD instrument, and analysis was performed using FlowJo 10 software. The gating strategy is summarized in Supplementary Figure 2.
Intracellular cytokine staining analyses were done applying boolean gates in FlowJo 10, subtracting unstimulated signals using Pestle v1.7 program and represented using SPICE v5.35 software (provided by the National Institute of Health, Mario Roeder, ImmunoTechnology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda).
CD8+ T-cell mediated viral inhibition capacity was measured at 1:1 and 1:10 CD8 effector to CD4 target ratios. Cryopreserved PBMCs were obtained from timepoints before the BCN02 intervention and CD8+ cells were depleted by magnetic bead separation (MACS Milteny Biotec). CD8+-depleted cells (CD4+-enriched fraction) were stimulated with PHA (5 g/ml) in RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum (R10) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/mL and streptavidin 100 g/ml). After 3 days of stimulation, the CD4-enriched fraction was infected by spinoculation with HIV-1BaL and HIV-1IIIB laboratory-adapted strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 as reported previously. HIV-infected cells were cultured in duplicates or triplicates in R10 medium with 20 U/ml of IL-2 in 96-well round-bottomed plates, alone or together with unstimulated CD8+ T cells obtained by positive magnetic bead separation the same day from an additional vial of frozen PBMC from screening (week 4), 3 weeks after MVA1 (week 3, postMVA1), 1 week after RMD3 (week 6, postRMD3), 4 weeks after MVA2 (week 13, postMVA2) timepoints. Cultures at different CD8:CD4 ratios (E:T = 1:1 and 1:10) were harvested after 6 days. Cells were stained first with Aqua Live/Dead stained for surface markers (CD3 APC-H7, BD Biosciences, CD4 PerCP, BD Biosciences, and CD8 APC, BD Biosciences), then permeabilized (FIX & PERM Cell Permeabilization Kit, ThermoFisher). Cells were then fixed (FIX & PERM Cell Permeabilization Kit, ThermoFisher) at room temperature and finally stained with anti-Gag p24 antibody (KC-57-FITC; Beckman Coulter). CD8+ T-cell antiviral activity is expressed as % inhibition = [(fraction of p24+ cells in CD4+ T cells cultured alone)(fraction of p24+ cells in CD4+ T cells cultured with CD8+ T cells)]/(fraction of p24+ in CD4+ T cells cultured alone)  100. At least 100,000 cells were collected on a LSRII BD cytometer and analysis was performed using FlowJo 10 software.
GraphPad Prism version 7 for Windows (San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis. Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon matched paired test were used for unpaired and paired comparisons, respectively. Significant values were considered for p < 0.05.
