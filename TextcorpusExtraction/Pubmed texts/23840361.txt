The population sample for the present study was selected from earlier studies. The population sample included: a) control group of 104 individuals from 254 participants; b) cocoa product group of 110 participants. The participants were recruited between April 2005 and June 2007. Inclusion criteria were community-dwelling men and women >20 years of age, with pre-hypertension (systolic BP: 120139 mmHg or diastolic BP: 8089 mmHG); stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP: 140159 mmHg or diastolic BP: 9099 mmHg); LDL-C ¥3.35 mmol/L [130 mg/dL] and 4.88 mmol/L [189 mg/dL]; and at least one other major CVD risk factor such as age >45 years in men and >55 in women, smoking habit, low HDL-C 1.03 mmol/L [40 mg/dL] in men and 1.19 mmol/L [46 mg/dL] in women, or family history of premature heart disease. Exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, any chronic disease, hypolipemic treatment, TG >3.97 mmol/L [350 mg/dL], BMI >35 Kg/m2, and a history of CVD. Participant eligibility or exclusion was assessed by the attending physician and was based of review of clinical records, followed by screening visits.
For the cocoa group (45 men and 65 women), during a stabilization period of 2 weeks, all participants received the cocoa cream product (composition as described in  Table 1 ) in order to assess the subject's tolerance to the product (13 g/unit; 1 g cocoa/unit, 6 units/d; 6 g cocoa/d; 465 Kcal/d) included in an isocaloric diet with 13% of total energy as saturated fatty acids (treated group). For the control group (46 men and 58 women), in the run-in period of 2 weeks duration, the participants consumed an isocaloric diet in which the percentage of saturated fatty acids in the diet was 13% of total energy.
Fasting blood samples from participants were obtained at the end of 2 weeks in each study for the isolation of peripheral leukocyte DNA.
All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment in the trial.
For the in vitro study, PBMCs were obtained from six adult volunteers (3 men and 3 women, aged 3034 years) with their oral informed consent.
The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Committee of the Hospital Universitary Sant Joan de Reus and at 3 Primary-Care Centers (Alcover, Vic, Centelles) where participants were recruited and the human experimentation was conducted. This study was conducted according to the guidelines established in the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered with CinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00502047 and NCT00511420.
The global methylation levels of peripheral leukocyte DNA from blood samples and cultured PBMCs were evaluated by measuring the 5mC content using reversed-phase HPLC. Blood samples were obtained from the treated and control subjects at week 2, and genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral leukocytes using a cell package commercial kit (Servicios Hospitalarios, Spain). DNA was extracted from the PBMCs using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, S.G. Servicios Hospitalarios S.L., Barcelona, Spain). The DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Wilmington DE, USA).
DNA digestion was performed essentially as described elsewhere but with a few modifications. Briefly, 30 µl of genomic DNA was treated with RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and RNase T1 (Sigma) at final concentrations of 100 U/mL and 2000 U/mL, respectively, and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The DNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated by sodium acetate (Sigma) and absolute ethanol, and washed twice with 70 per cent ethanol. Afterwards, the DNA was resuspended with 30 µl of 1 deoxyribonuclease I digestion buffer and 10 U of DNaseI (New England Biolabs, IZASA S.A., Barcelona, Spain), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37°C. Sodium acetate (pH 5.2), zinc sulphate, and nuclease P1 (Sigma) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 7 h at 37°C. After the digestion, 1/10 volume of 10 alkaline phosphatase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2) and 10.8 U of alkaline phosphatase were added to the DNA solution. Additionally, 2 µl of tetrahydrouridine (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA, USA) was added to prevent the adventitious formation of dU by cytidine deaminase, and the solution was incubated overnight at 37°C. Finally, DNA hydrolysate was filtered using a 0.45-µm filter (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland), and the samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
Commercially available (TCI Europe, Borenveldgewes, Belgium) nucleotide standards for 2-deoxyadenosine (dA; D0046), 2-deoxyguanosine (dG; D0052), thymidine (dT; T0233), and 2-deoxycytidine (dC; D3583) at 100 µM and 2-deoxyuridine (dU) and 2-deoxy-5-methylcytidine (5mC; D0046) at 5 µM were used to prepare a mixed sample of all six nucleotides to generate calibration curves for each sample batch. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 2.0 to 100.0 µM for dC, dG, dT and dA and in the range of 0.15.0 µM for 5mC and dU, spanning the expected concentration ranges of the samples. The daily precision was examined by analysing the deoxynucleoside standards (100 µM dC, dG, dT, and dA and 5 µM 5mC and dU) at the start and end of every experiment.
The 5mC content was measured using an Agilent 1100 Series liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies) at room temperature. The column was an Eclipse Plus C18 column (2504.6 mm, 5 µm) with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus-C18 guard column (12.54.6 mm, 5 µm) (Agilent Technologies). The mobile phase was 50 mM ammonium orthophosphate, pH 4.1, which was prepared by dissolving 50 mmol of diammonium orthophosphate in 50 mM orthophosphoric acid with a subsequent adjustment of the pH to 4.14. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, with a 20 µl injection volume, and the sample detection was set to 275 nm (UV).
For each sample, at least two separate aliquots of DNA were digested and chromatographed. All DNA samples were analyzed in duplicate, and we eliminated samples for which the difference in the 5mC content between duplicate samples was greater than 0.3%.
The area of each peak was used for the quantitative analysis. The sample concentrations were calculated from the curves using a linear regression, and the level of 5mC in the DNA samples was then expressed as a percentage of the level of dC, which was calculated using the following equation: %5mC=[5mC/(dC+5mC)]100.
The analyzed SNPs were selected using two criteria. Because there are many SNPs in each of the three DNMTs, the majority of which are located in introns with unknown functional effects, we used HapMap (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to select haplotype tagging SNPs to include in the analysis (Tagger-Pairwise, Hap Map Data Phase III/Rel#2, Feb09, on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b126 for the CEU population, r2 threshold ¥0.8 and MAF¥0.10). In addition, to select polymorphisms in genes that encode the MTHFR and MTRR enzymes, we used PubMed to identify SNPs that had previously been reported in the literature to have functional effects. To ensure a wide number of subjects who are homozygous for the rare alleles, we selected only those polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency in Europeans of at least 10%, as indicated by the SNP public database (dbSNP; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=snp). Finally, a total of two MTHFR (by rs number: rs180133, rs180131), two MTRR (rs1801394, rs1532268), three DNMT1 (rs2162560, rs759920, rs7253062), four DNMT3A (rs2304429, rs2289195, rs13002567, rs734693) and three DNMT3B (rs998382, rs4911263, rs2424932) SNPs were included.
Genotyping of the selected polymorphisms was performed using the Iplex Gold Sequenom technology (coordinacion.cegen@upf.edu).
The cocoa extract used for this study was produced from cocoa nibs. The total polyphenol content of this cocoa extract, measured using Folin-Ciocalteu's method, was 302.5 mg/g. The majority of the polyphenols were monomeric (catechin, 2.374 mg/g and epicatechin, 5.638 mg/g), dimeric (13.20 mg/g), trimeric (6.216 mg/g), tetrameric (1.571 mg/g) or oligomeric (59 units, 0.3 mg/g) proanthocyanidins (measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography MS). The cocoa extract used in the in vitro experiments had similar characteristics to that used in the human intervention study.
PBMCs were isolated from 20 mL EDTA anticoagulated blood of six volunteers by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque¢ PLUS (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and stored in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed by slow reconstitution with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Lonza, Barcelona, Spain). The PBMCs fraction was adjusted to 1.0106 cells/mL, and 1 mL of cells was aliquoted into each well of the 12-well flat-bottom plates.
To evaluate the effect of the cocoa extract on mRNA expression, the cells were treated with 10 µl of a cocoa extract with two final concentrations (25 mg/L and 50 mg/L) dissolved in 5% DMSO. The cells treated only with vehicle (5% DMSO) served as controls. The cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 h and 24 h. The cell culture experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated two times. After treatment, the cells were obtained by centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C.
To evaluate the effect of the cocoa extract on the global DNA methylation, the PBMCs were treated with the highest concentration of cocoa extract (50 mg/L) for 72 h. The detection of the global DNA methylation in the PBMCs cultures was performed as described above.
The total RNA from the PBMCs samples was extracted using a combination of Tripure Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) and an RNeasy MiniElute¢ Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, S.G. Servicios Hospitalarios S.L., Barcelona, Spain), dissolved in 22 µl of RNase free water and stored at 80°C. The RNA yield was quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Wilmington DE, USA).
The reverse transcription reactions were performed with 400 ng of RNA that was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. An analysis of the relative gene expression for DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, MTHFR and MTRR was performed using real-time quantitative PCR in a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For the amplification reactions, the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and Inventoried Gene Assay Products (Applied Biosystems) containing 2 gene-specific primers and 1 TaqMan MGB probe (6-FAM dye-labelled) from Applied Biosystems were used (assay IDs DNMT1: Hs00154749_m1, DNMT3A: Hs01027166_m1, DNMT3B: Hs00171876_m1, MTHFR: Hs00195560_m1, MTRR: Hs00985015_m1). The thermal cycle conditions were as follows: first cycle at 50°C for 2 minutes followed by 95°C for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds followed by 60°C for 1 minute. A no-template control was included in each assay. RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) was used as an endogenous control, and a vehicle control was used as a calibrator. The expression levels of the target transcripts in each sample were calculated using the comparative Ct method (2Ct formula) after normalization to RPLP0 mRNA.
The cocoa extract toxicity on cultured PBMCs was determined by measuring the amount of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture supernatants. The PBMCs were incubated in 12-well plates at a density of 1106 cells/well with different concentrations of cocoa extract (1, 10, 50, 100, and 250 mg/L) for 24 h. After incubation, the LDH activity in the medium was measured by analyzing the NAD reduction using an LDH kit (QCA, Barcelona, Spain) according to the manufacturer's instructions and measuring the absorbance at 340 nm.
The LDH activity was expressed as the percentage of the total LDH cellular released following the addition of (0.1%) Triton X-100. The survival of the vehicle-treated control cultures receiving no cocoa extracts was defined as 100%, and that of the treated groups was expressed as a percentage of the control group. The results are given as the mean ( SD) of different incubations, each performed in triplicate.
A deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for genotype frequencies at individual loci was assessed using standard chi-squared tests. To compare the means of continuous descriptive variables between treatment groups and to study the cocoa consumption response differences on the global DNA methylation between groups, an analysis of covariance was used (ANCOVA). The independent variables (covariates) were determined using a stepwise regression (successive steps). A Fisher exact test was used for the categorical variables. To study the cocoa consumption response differences on the global DNA methylation according to genotypes, ANCOVA was used for all of the analyses with the %5mC defined as the dependent variable and the treatment and covariates included in the model. The analyses were performed under the recessive, dominant, and codominant models. For the analyses of the mRNA expression levels and the global DNA methylation levels in PBMCs, a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test or a two-way ANOVA was used.
With 104 and 110 subjects per group, the study has 90% power to detect a difference of at least 0.5% in %5mC assuming a SD of 0.800, with a global two-sided alpha of 5%.
The experimental results with continuous variables are expressed as the mean  SEM or the mean  SD, whereas the human data results of %5mC are expressed as the least-square mean  SEM or the least-square mean and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each genotype.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was considered at p0.05. For genotypes analysis, we applied step-down Sidak adjustment to correct for multiple testing and the two p values are presented.
