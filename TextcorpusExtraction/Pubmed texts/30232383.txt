This study was a randomized single-blind prospective cohort trial. It was registered at http://www.ClinicalTrial.com. (ClinicalTrial-NCI-03339414) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). The use of human blood in our study (ID 2013-026283-1) was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Xuanwu Hospital (No. Xuanwu 130-63528), and informed consent was obtained from each subject. Furthermore, the studies were conducted as outlined in the IRB protocol. This case-control study included 21 aortic dissection patients who were classified according to the Stanford classification: Stanford A1 (n=13); A2 (n=4); A3 (n=1); B1 (n=1); and B3 (n=1); and aortic dilation (n=1). Patients received standard perioperative monitoring and conventional intravenous inhalation anaesthesia. A median sternotomy was performed, an arterial cannula was inserted into the right axillary artery, and a dual-stage atriocaval cannula was placed in the right atrium, as routinely established for cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow rate was maintained between 2.5 and 2.8L/min/m2. During the cooling phase, the antegrade perfusion of cold-blood cardioplegia solution was directly infused into the coronary ostia. Circulatory arrest was established when the nasopharyngeal temperature reached 1820°C. An alpha-stat acid-base management strategy was used while nasopharyngeal temperatures were ¥28°C; a pH-stat acid-base management strategy was used throughout the DHCA procedure when the nasopharyngeal temperature was <18°C. The carotid artery and subclavian artery were clamped, and antegrade selective cerebral perfusion commenced via the right axillary artery at rate of 10mL/kg/min. The details of these procedures have been described previously. Blood samples were drawn preoperatively, and at 0, 8, 12, 24, 36h postoperatively from all patients. Whole blood samples (510mL) were collected into sodium EDTA tubes, of which 0.25L was mixed immediately with 0.75L of TRIpure LS Reagent (BioTake Co.). The resulting mixture was frozen at 80°C until analysed.
Primary neuron cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of embryonic day 17 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously. Briefly, cortices were dissected and dissociated, and the cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified chamber (95% air, 5% CO2). Cultures were used for experiments 7 to 10 days after seeding.
Total RNA was extracted from the primary cultured cells using a commercially available kit (RNeasy Plus Mini Kit [50], QIAGEN, USA), according to manufacturers instructions. For the miRNA assay, total RNA (containing miRNAs) was reverse-transcribed using hairpin-loop primers designed to target the specific miRNA (miR-194-5p) at a concentration of 600ng/L used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis PrimeScriptTM 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Clontech, Cat#6110A). Semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using RT2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 330520), with U6 expression levels as an internal reference. For the mRNA assay, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligoDT primers at a concentration of 600ng/L used for cDNA synthesis PrimeScriptTM 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Clontech, Cat#6110A). TaqMan mRNA assays (Applied Biosystems Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to quantify SUMO2 mRNA (Rn00821719-g1, Invitrogen) expression levels, in accordance with the manufacturers protocol. B2m (Rn00560865-m1, Invitrogen) expression levels were used as an internal reference. The CT values of the different samples were compared using the 2CT method. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using 20ng of cDNA in a 20L volume and the ABI 7500 System. qRT-PCR measurements were performed to obtain a mean CT value for each sample.
Primary mouse cortical neurons (day 7 in vitro) were fixed at 4°C overnight and treated with 5 ug/mL proteinase K for 5min in room temperature. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5min per wash. Mature miR-194-5p was detected using miR-194-5p DIG-labelled LNA at both the 5 and 3 ends with digoxigenin probe (TCCACATGGAGTTGCTGTTAGA; Exiqon) and were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 SSC, 200 ug/mL yeast tRNA, 200 ug/mL salmon sperm DNA, 1 Denhardts solution, 10% dextran sulphate (wt/vol). LNA-modified miR-194-5p were diluted to a final concentration of 40nM in hybridization buffer, heated to 90°C for 5min and separately hybridized to the sections at 55°C for 2h in a hybridization oven (Shake N Bake, Boekel, Feasterville, PA, USA). The slides were then washed three times in 0.1 SSC (without probe) at 42°C, followed by washing twice in 2 SSC at room temperature, then incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10min at room temperature. They were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, in 1 PBS for 1h at room temperature and incubated with anti-digoxigenin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:400, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for 30min at room temperature. The slides were washed twice with PBST and incubated for signal amplification (for the in situ, now labelled with horseradish peroxidase) using the TSA Cy5 kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturers protocol. After three PBST washes (5min each), the slides were mounted and stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). The specificity of the miR-194-5p signal in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments was confirmed when compared with a scrambled control. The scrambled probes emitted no signal in the neurons.
The Rno-miR-194-5p mirVanaTM miRNA mimic ID:AM10004 (Ambion, AM17000); or Scramble ID:AM10004 (Ambion, AM17000), mixed with Lipofectamine RNAi-MAX Reagent (Invitrogen, 13778-075), were added to the primary rat neuron (7 days in vitro) culture medium according to manufacturers instructions. For the transfection efficiency assay, primary rat neurons were transfected with miR-194-5p were labelled with FAM fluorescence (miRCURY LNA Power Inhibitor of miR-194-5p in-vivo grade, 5 FAM) (Exiqon, CAC00036303) for flow cytometry analysis. Briefly, attached neurons were gently trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,000g for 5min, then labelled with Zombie VioletTM Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend, 423113) to identify dead cells, 1µl Zombie VioletTM reagent was added into the 1-ml culture medium, then incubated for 10min at culture temperature. After being washed in PBS, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). FAM fluorescence was assayed using LSR II (BD Biosciences) and used for fluorescence acquisition. Unstained neurons (as control group) also fixed were used to determined appropriate gating parameters and voltages. The data were analysed using Flow Jo software.
Cultures were rinsed twice with PBS and the cells were collected into Pro-PREP Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology, 17081). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were loaded onto 420% Tris-glycine gels. After electrophoresis and transferring to nitrocellulose membranes (Novex), the membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 and 0.2% (wt/vol) I-block (Tropix, T2015) for 90min at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with following primary antibodies, anti- -actin (1: 1,000, Sigma-Aldrich, A5441, Dorset, UK), SUMO2/3-specific antibody (1: 1,000, Abcam, ab3742, Cambridge, MA, USA). After incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, NA931 (anti-mouse), or NA934 (anti-rabbit), Pittsburgh, PA, USA), the blots were developed using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate Plus. Densitometric analysis was performed using Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR Biosciences) after scanning with the GE Healthcare Imager 600. For the immunocytochemistry, cells were and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) in PBS as described previously and incubated with primary antibodies against SUMO2/3 (1: 200, Abcam, ab3742). MAP2 (1: 500, Abcam, ab5392) After staining with primary antibody, fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody, nuclei were counter-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Immunostaining was analysed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-S, LosAngels, CA, USA) interfaced with a digital charge-coupled device camera and an image analysis system.
OGD experiments were performed using a specialized, humidified chamber (Heidolph, incubator 1000, Brinkmann Instruments) maintained at 37°C, which contained an anaerobic gas mixture (90% N2, 5% H2, and 5% CO2). For hypothermia OGD, the OGD chamber was set to room temperature (25°C). To initiate OGD, culture medium was replaced with deoxygenated, glucose-free DMEM (Life Technologies, USA). After a 2h challenge, cultures were removed from the anaerobic chamber, and the OGD solution in the cultures was replaced with maintenance medium. Neurons were then allowed to recover for 18h in a regular incubator before the neurotoxicity assay.
Cell viability was quantified using the Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo) according to manufacturers instructions. CCK-8 solution (10L) was added to each well of the plate, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2h. The optical density at a wavelength of 450nm was measured using a microplate reader. The relative assessments of neuronal injury were normalized by comparison with control neurons, in which cell survival was defined to be 100%. Cell viability was also assessed after staining of neuron cultures with propidium iodide (PI) to distinguish between living and dead cells (0.001mg/mL for 5minutes with subsequent rinsing) and five images per well were taken and quantified as ratios versus all neurons under bright light.
All values are presented as meanstandard deviation(SD) of at least three independent experiments. For measurement data, multiple comparisons were evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer test for pair-wise comparisons between all groups. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA was followed by Bonferroni test. An unpaired t-test was used only for two-group comparisons. Differences with P<0.05 was considered to be statically significant.
