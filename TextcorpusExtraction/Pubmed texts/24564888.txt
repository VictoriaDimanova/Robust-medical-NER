All tumor tissues and serum were collected under the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols at City of Hope National Medical Center (COH) or Zhejiang University respectively. The patients were given informed consent. One hundred and forty-two breast tumor tissues, including 21 TNBC and 121 Non-TNBC tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry staining. We also collected 30 sera from TNBC and Non-TNBC patients respectively with the assistance from the COH Translational Research Laboratory Core for ELISA assay. Immunohistochemical staining and FISH confirmed that ER/PR/HER2 were negatively expressed, as assessed by pathologists in the Department of Pathology of COH.
For differential expression analysis, differential expression P-values were determined via t-test in R. Significant results are expected to show P-value<0.05. Differential expression between TNBC and non-TNBC was determined using data from 3 cohorts (Chin et al., expO (GSE2109), and TCGA. Differential expression between patients that did or did not develop metastatic tumors was determined using 2 cohorts (expO (GSE2109), TCGA for WNT5B and 1 cohort (Desmedt et al.) for MCL1. For survival analysis, differences in survival between high and low expression groups were visualized in Kaplan-Meier plots and compared using Cox regression analysis, with P-values calculated via log-rank test, using the survival package in R (A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing). The disease-free survival of WNT5B was quantified independently for 2 cohorts (Desmedt et al. and Wang et al.) respectively. And then meta-analysis was conducted by utilizing the same WNT5B probe (so that the signals would be comparable) for an 80 month observation period. The disease-free survival of MCL1 was analyzed by the same method using the cohort of Desmedt et al.
Total RNA extraction from MDA-MB-231 was carried out using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For cDNA synthesis, total RNA (1 g) was transcribed using random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers protocol. For quantification of OXPHOS-related genes, the cDNA amplication program included a denature at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s; 58°C for 30 s. For MtDNA detection, total cellular DNA was isolated with DNAeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Mitochondrial DNA content was determined by qPCR by using comparing the mitochondrially encoded Cox2 gene to an intron of the nuclear-encoded -globin (HBB) gene. All qPCR was performed using an iQ5 iCycler (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers instructions. Data were analyzed using Bio-Rad iQ5 Optical System Software v2.0. All products yielded a single band with the predicted size. All primers are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 and all products yielded a single band with the predicted size.
Cell protein was extracted from cells using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) with phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Equal amount of protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. After the protein was transferred onto a membrane, the blot was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS and probed overnight at 4°C using the following antibodies: WNT5B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), Cyclin E (M20), TOM20 (F-10), Myc (9E10), AIF (E-1), MCL1 (S-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Caspsae-3, Caspase-8,PGC-, Cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and -actin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Appropriate antibodies were used for secondary antibody reaction. Signal was detected by the ECL Plus Western Blot Detecting System (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).
The triple negative cell lines MDA-MB-231was purchased from ATCC and cultured in the recommended media. Specific lentivirus shRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to disrupt the expression of WNT5B while shRNA targeting non-mammalian sequence (Sigma-Aldrich) served as control. WNT5B expression was determined by immunoblot analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells that expressed WNT5B or control shRNA (shWNT5B or shCtl cells) were cultured in growth medium to observe cell growth. Cells (3  104/ml) were seeded into 24-well plates, and cell number was counted every day for five days using a Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA). Independent experiments were performed in triplicate.
Cells were infected with shCtl or shWNT5B lentivirus and the morphology was observed and photographed after WNT5B expression was inhibited. Cell mobility was determined by a wound closure assay. Cells were placed onto 6-well plates at 80% confluence and cultured in serum-depleted media for 40 h. A wound was made by scraping the monolayer cells with a plastic pipette tip and fresh serum-free medium was replenished. Images of wound closure were photographed at 0, 16, 24 and 40 h post-scraping.
Cells were trypsinized, resuspend in fresh medium followed by flowcytometry analysis. For cell cycle assay, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were then suspended in PBS and treated with RNase A (final concentration 100ug/ml) at 37°C for 30 min. After removing RNase A, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) at 5ug/ml for 10 min and the cell cycle was determined by flowcytometry analysis. For apoptosis assay, FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit was used for staining the cells following products manual (BD bioscience). All flowcytometry data were analyzed using Summit v4.3 software.
All the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides were prepared and stained by the Pathology Core Facility at COH using a standard protocol. Antibodies used in this study were: rabbit polyclonal antibodyWNT5B (SAB2900204) (1:20 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal antibody Myc (SC-40) (1:75 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit monoclonal antibody MCL1 (ab32087) (1: 100 dilution, Abcam). All antibodies were titrated with negative and positive controls to obtain optimal staining.
The cells infected with shWNT5B or shCtl were collected in 3 days. The electron microscope was done in the core facility at COH following their standard protocol. It has been described in detail elsewhere. The stained sections were subjected to Electron microscopy, which was done on an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 2 K CCD camera.
The XF24 flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) was used to measure OCR in 24-well microplates. Six thousand cells transduced with shCtl and 12000 cells infected with shWNT5B lenti-virus were seeded onto 24-well plates and incubated 3 days. The measurement, recording procedure and data analysis were described previously. For cellular ATP measurement, we used ENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence Detection Kit (Promega Madison, WI). Briefly, the adherent cells in 6-well plate were collected by 2 mM EDTA in PBS on ice, TCA was add at final concentration of 1% and vortex vigorously for 10 sec. It was further diluted to 0.1% TCA by Tris-Acetate (pH=7.75). The standard as well as the samples were serially diluted by dilution buffer (0.1% TCA/0.08PBS/0.9Tris-Acetate) and subjected to luminescence measurement.
To measure soluble WNT5B in patients serum, we used WNT5B ELISA Kit (USCN Life Science Inc.). The manufactures protocol was totally followed for preparing samples and all the reactions. The plate was read by SpectramaxPlus (Molecular Devices).
ShWNT5B- or shCtl- virus transduced MDA-MB-231 cells were distributed into 12-well plates the day before transfection. Cells at 80% confluence were co-transfected with TCF-driven Topflash reporter plasmid (Millipore) (1 g) and control Renilla luciferease (20 ng) using 2.5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in 1X passive lysis buffer in 48 h and the supernatant was collected for Dual-luciferase activity measurement (Promega, Madison, WI). For each sample, firefly luciferase activity was normalized with an internal control, Renilla luciferase activity.
