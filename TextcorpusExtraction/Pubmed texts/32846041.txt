The BEARSMART trial was an openlabel, randomized clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01958034), where patients with MI, after providing informed consent, were randomized within 24 h of percutaneous coronary revascularization in a 1:1 ratio to BE supplementation or no dietary intervention. All subjects received standard medical treatment. The trial was approved by the regional ethics review board in Uppsala, Sweden (Drn: 2013/311). Patient information, BE characteristics, as well as administration protocols are included in Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S1, Supporting Information. Subject exclusion criteria had previously been described.[  29  ] Patients randomized to BEsupplemented group ingested three doses of 13.3 g of BE each day, totaling 40 g daily that corresponded to 480 g fresh bilberries. The extract (Immune, Sweden, www.immun.se) contained 2250 mg of anthocyanins per 100 g; thus, the patients consumed 300 mg anthocyanins in a single dose.
Citrated blood samples were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks. The blood was drawn according to hospital procedures and regulations, and centrifuged within 30 min. Before freezing at 80 °C, plasma samples were centrifuged to avoid contamination with platelet fragments. The obtained cellfree plasma was aliquoted and stored at 80 °C.
The AcouTrap acoustic trapping platform (AcouSort AB, Sweden) for EV enrichment from plasma samples had previously been described.[  27  b,  54  ] In the acoustic trapping method of MV enrichment, 12 µm polystyrene beads, socalled seed particles, were retained within a glass capillary by an acoustic standing wave. Diluted plasma sample was then aspirated and MVs were retained within the cluster of the seed particles. For the flow cytometry experiments, the samples were thawed at 37 °C and diluted 1:2 in PBS. 50 µL, of the diluted plasma was aspirated into the seed particle cluster, at a speed of 25 µL min1. The trapped MVs were then washed with 50 µL of PBS and released in 100 µL of PBS.
Some samples were excluded from further analysis, because of the physical properties of these samples (e.g., high viscosity and lipid content) that interfered with platelet elimination during centrifugation. Due to these issues, values from 16 and 18 subjects in the bilberry intervention and the nonintervention groups were reported, respectively.
100 µL of eluted MV suspension was stained with 3 µL of PEconjugated antibodies (Abs) against CD62E or glycoprotein IX (CD42a) (BD Biosciences, US). Samples were analyzed with Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences, US) cytometer as previously described.[  27  b] 
Trapped plasma samples were diluted with DPBS, stained with CD62E and CD42a Abs, further diluted with DPBS, and analyzed by NanoSight LM10 (Malvern, UK) equipped with 488 nm blue laser. Samples were measured for 60 s in quadruplicates using manual gain, camera level set to 5 and detection threshold to 33 (unstained), or camera level set to 13 and detection threshold to 4 (stained). Abonly and PBS controls were used to ensure rigorous measurement of the vesicles. The obtained data was analyzed with NTA 3.2.16 software (Malvern, UK).
BE was prepared from V. myrtillus as described by Arevstrm et al.[  29  ] For measuring the effect on in vitro toxicity and cell proliferation, HUVECs were seeded in 6well dishes covered with attachment factor and cultured in Medium 200 with LSGS (final serum concentration 2%) and gentamycin/amphotericin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). 100 mg of bilberry powder was diluted in 1 mL water, incubated in 60 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20 000  g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant (the BE) was aspirated and added to fresh culture medium to prepare BEcontaining medium. The mixture was further incubated with confluent cells to obtain 1000, 100, and 10 µg mL1 final concentrations. After 24 h incubation, the cells were harvested, stained with trypan blue for viability and cell proliferation assessment. 1000 µg mL1 BE was chosen as the working concentration for further experiments due to the lack of toxic effects on the cells (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). The concentration of BE chosen for the in vitro study (1 mg mL1 BE, thus 0.0225 mg mL1 anthocyanins) clearly exceeded the concentration of anthocyanins in the clinical study (300 mg three times per day). The reasons for this were that both cellular context and time frame were different from the clinical study (hours instead of weeks). According to the literature, 1200 mg of blueberry anthocyanins resulted in a maximal plasma concentration of 36 nmol L1.[  2  ] The concentration of total anthocyanins in blood was not determined in the original study but, based on the report by Manach et al.,[  2  ] it could be assumed that the maximal plasma concentration of anthocyanins could end up to be 9 nmol L1, whereas for the in vitro study it would be about 12 µmol L1 (22.5 µg mL1). However, in the original study the concentrations of anthocyaninderived metabolites in blood were measured and high concentrations were found. For example, the concentrations reached 875 nmol L1 for vanillic acid4Osulfate, 21 nmol L1 for gallic acid, 26.9 nmol L1 for caffeic acid 4dglucuronide and, 6.4 nmol L1 for pcoumaric acid.[  29  ] All the abovementioned compounds were significantly different from the control group.
12  103 HUVECs were seeded in 12well dishes and cultured for 24 h. 1000 µg mL1 BE or fresh culture medium (control) were added and cultured for 24 h. 300 µm of P2X7 agonist bzATP (SigmaAldrich, Germany) and 100 nm of P2X7 antagonist AZ11645373 (SigmaAldrich, Germany) were prepared from stock solutions in the culture medium. The diluted compounds or fresh culture medium were added to the calceinstained cells (see below) and incubated for the next 24 h. Three different HUVEC lots below passage 4 were used in the in vitro experiments.
2 mm calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) stock was prepared in DMSO and serially diluted in HBSS with 0.1% BSA to obtain 2 µm working solution with trace amounts of DMSO. After the compound incubation, the cells were washed twice with HBSS. 1 mL of calcein solution was added per well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were then washed with HBSS and fresh culture medium was added. After 24 h incubation, the medium was collected, centrifuged at 2000  g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and analyzed using CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). All values were normalized to that of the control cells.
HUVECs were plated in 6well plates. After 24 h, 1000 µg mL1 BE was added and the cells were harvested after 3 or 6 h with 200 µL RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, US) containing phosphatase inhibitors. The samples were vortexed, incubated at 4 °C for 5 min, sonicated and centrifuged at 15 000  g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then transferred to new tubes and kept frozen at 80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 µg of protein were loaded on precast polyacrylamide midi gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V and dry transfer was performed on nitrocellulose membrane via iBlot 2 transferring system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) for 1 h. Primary Abs against phosphoAkt (pAkt) clone D9E, Akt clone 11E7, phosphop38 (pp38) clone D3F9, p38 clone D13E1, and actin clone 13E5 (Cell Signaling, US) were diluted as per manufacturer's instructions in 5% BSA in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary goat antirabbit Ab (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) was diluted 1:2500 in 5% BSA in TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized with Pico Chemiluminescent Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) and analyzed with Odyssey Fc (LICOR, US) and Image Studio v. 3.1.4.
HUVECs were plated and treated with 1000 µg mL1 BE or combinations of bzATP and AZ11645373 as previously described. The cells were harvested with 700 µL QIAzol (Qiagen, Germany), incubated for 5 min in RT, and frozen at 80 °C. RNA isolation was performed with miRNeasy kit with DNase digestion (Qiagen, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions. High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) was used for reverse transcription. The mRNA levels for P2X7, Rab27b, Rab27a, SMPD1, and ARF6 with GAPDH as a reference gene were assessed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) and 20 ng template as per manufacturer's instructions.
Shapiro test of normality showed that the MV concentration in patient plasma was not normally distributed. Thus, MannWhitney U test was applied to compare differences between BE supplementation and no supplementation after 8 weeks. In vitro compound effects on ECs were analyzed with oneway ANOVA with false discovery rate (FDR) correction of Benjamini and Hochberg. pvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).
