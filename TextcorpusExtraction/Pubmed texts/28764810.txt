BM samples from 28 (17 male and 11 female) de novo acquired AA patients with a median age of 31 years (range 1859 years) were analyzed after the signing of a written informed consent form in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Committee for Medical Care and Safety, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College (ethical approval documents reference number KT2014005-EC-1). This cohort consisted of four patients with severe AA and 24 with nonsevere AA. The diagnosis and severity classification of AA was established by morphological examination of the BM and peripheral blood samples after excluding any other acquired BM failure syndromes, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome, and congenital BM failure syndromes, according to international criteria. Samples from 19 (14 male and 5 female) age-matched (range 2056 years) healthy controls were obtained after they had signed the written informed consent form described above.
Our experimental research on NOD/SCID and nude mice followed internationally recognized guidelines. Ethical approval for the animal experiments was provided by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College. The ethical approval documents reference number is KT2012003-m-6.
BM-MSCs were isolated and cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium. BM-MSCs were identified by their surface markers with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against CD13 (WM15), CD29 (MAR4), CD44 (G44-26), CD49e (IIA1), CD73 (AD2), CD105 (266), CD166 (3A6), CD31 (WM59), CD34 (581), CD45 (HI30), CD90 (5E10), HLA-ABC (G46-2.6), HLA-DR (G46-6), CD14 (M5E2), CD40 (5C3), and CD11b (ICRF44), along with the appropriate isotype monoclonal antibodies using a FACScanflow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
RNA samples were first treated with DNase I to degrade any possible DNA contamination. Next, mRNA was enriched using oligo (dT) magnetic beads for eukaryotes and fragmented into short fragments of approximately 200 bp. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer-primer, and then buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second strand. Double-stranded cDNA was purified with magnetic beads, followed by end reparation and 3-end single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. A sample library was qualified and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and an ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) during the quantitative-competitive (QC) step. Library products were ready for sequencing via Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) or other sequencer when necessary. Next, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm the gene expression levels of RNA transcripts with sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers as described previously.
MSCs were labeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD106 antibody (BD Biosciences). CD106+ MSCs and CD106 MSCs were separated using a CD106-positive selection magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. CD106+ MSCs or CD106 MSCs (¥90% purity) were used for subsequent experiments.

The expression of cell surface molecules was assessed according to the manufacturers instructions. Normal MSCs (N MSCs) were stained for CD106 and NF-kB. N MSCs were first washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and then blocked with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/5% normal serum) for 60 min. N MSCs were labeled with mouse-anti-human CD106 overnight and then labeled with Alexa Fluor 546-goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min. N MSCs with 0.3% Triton¢ X-100 for 60 min were labeled with rabbit-anti-human NF-B overnight and then labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit) for 60 min. The nucleus was marked with DAPI.
Selected CD106+/CD106 MSCs were stained for NF-B and nuclei to examine the NF-B expression level. The expression of NF-B was calculated as the mean of the fluorescence intensity in 6 continuous views. CD106+/CD106 MSCs were first washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and then blocked with blocking buffer (PBS/5% normal serum/0.3% Triton¢ X-100) for 60 min. Then, CD106+/CD106 MSCs were labeled with rabbit-anti-human NF-B overnight and then labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min. The nucleus was marked with DAPI.

Western blotting procedures were performed according to the protocol described by Song et al.. Briefly, BM-MSCs were collected, washed, and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) supplemented with PMSF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total protein was extracted and quantified by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). A total of 30 g protein was denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The transferred membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST, incubated with anti-human CD106 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) overnight, and then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 for 2 h. Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Thermo-Fisher, Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) detection reagents, and scanned images were quantified using Image J (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The ratio of target gene to -actin was used for the semiquantification and comparison between the two groups.
