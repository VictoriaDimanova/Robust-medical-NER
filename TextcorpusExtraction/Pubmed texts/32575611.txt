Data and biologic samples for the present analysis were derived from the FlaxFX study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover intervention comparing supplemental flaxseed lignan extract to a placebo (Figure S1). Each intervention period lasted 60 days with at least a 60-day washout period between the two interventions. All study procedures and materials were approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) Institutional Review Board, and informed, written consent was obtained from all participants prior to their starting the study. The study was registered at  as NCT01619020.
Details regarding recruitment have been published previously. Briefly, healthy men and women, aged 20 to 45 years, were recruited from the greater Seattle area between September 2012 and August 2016. Exclusion criteria included age <20 or >45 years, tobacco use, consumption of >2 alcoholic beverages/day (equivalent to 720 mL beer, 240 mL wine, or 90 mL hard liquor), regular use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, oral or IV antibiotic use within the past 3 months, weight loss or gain of >4.5 kg in the past year, current or planned pregnancy, breastfeeding, chronic medical illness, history of gastrointestinal disorder and cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), known allergy to nuts, seeds, and flaxseed, inability to swallow pills, and dietary fiber intake ¥20 g/day as assessed using the Block Fruit/Vegetable/Fiber Screener (Nutrition Quest, Berkeley, CA, USA). The rationale for excluding individuals with higher fiber intakes was to reduce exposure to other plant lignans associated with intake of high-fiber foods.
Participants who met the initial eligibility criteria completed a self-administered food frequency questionnaire and a health and demographic survey, and provided a stool sample. After completing the stool collection, prospective participants also consumed the study flaxseed lignan extract for 3 days and completed a 24-h urine collection on the third day in order to characterize participants as low- or high-ENL excreters for randomization. Individuals still interested in participating in the intervention underwent further screening before randomization, including a medical history, measurement of blood pressure and complete blood count, liver panel, chemistry panel, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine measured in a fasting blood draw, and a urine pregnancy test in women.
Eligible participants were randomly assigned, blocked on sex and lignan-metabolism status (i.e., ratio of ENL/ (secoisolariciresinol (SECO) + END + ENL) in 24-h urine after 3 days of a daily lignan capsule), to the order in which they received the lignan extract or placebo. Participants consumed the lignan extract capsule containing 50 mg secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) plus rice bran (Barlenes Organic Oils, Ferndale, WA, USA), or a visually identical placebo (only rice bran), as one capsule by mouth daily for 60 days. Capsules were packaged by the manufacturer in sealed plastic bottles with a count of 70 capsules per bottle, with all active capsules from the same lot. Separate testing of the lignan extract in triplicate by HPLC confirmed that the mean SDG content was within specifications. The mean lariciresinol and pinoresinol (other plant lignans) content was 0.8 and 3.0 mg/capsule, respectively. During each intervention period, adherence to the study capsules was monitored by pill count. Compliance based on capsules returned was 98% with only one participant falling under 80% compliance during one study period (62% capsules returned during placebo period).
Fasting blood samples were collected at the baseline and at the end of each period after a 12-h overnight fast. Blood was collected into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA and was processed and stored as plasma at 80 °C using a standard protocol. Participants collected 24-h urine and stool samples at the beginning and end of each intervention period. Stool samples were collected into RNAlater for bacterial measures as described.
Bile acid concentrations were carried out by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described. Briefly, 200 L plasma were combined with 600 L HPLC-grade methanol and 10 L solution containing 10 M of each stable-isotope labeled internal standard (d4-IS): Cholic acid2,2,4,4D4 (CA-D4), deoxycholic acid2,2,4,4D4 (DCA-D4), glycocholic acid2,2,4,4D4 (GCA-D4), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid2,2,4,4D4 (GCDCA-D4). The samples were vortexed for 10 s, stored for 20 min at 20 °C. After centrifuge at 18,000 g for 15 min (4 °C), 650 L supernatant was dried at 30 °C in a Speed-Vac for 3 h. The samples were reconstituted in MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v) to 100 L and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 5 min (4 °C). Ninety µL aliquots were transferred into LC vials prior MS analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using a Waters Acquity I-Class system and a Waters X Select HSS T3 column (2.5 µm, 2.1  150 mm). The mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate in H2O, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% acetic acid. Gradient elution mode was as follows: 0.01.0 min, 75% A; 1.015.0 min, 5% A; 15.025.0 min, 5% A; 25.025.1 min, 75% A, 25.140.0 min 75% A. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, column temperature 40 °C, and injection volume 2 L. Data were measured on a Waters Xevo TQ-S micro mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The ESI conditions were as follows: Electrospray negative ionization mode; voltage 2.0 kV; cone voltage 30 V; source offset 50 V; desolvation temperature 600 °C; cone gas flow 150 L·h1; desolvation gas flow 1000 L·h1. Mass measures of fifty-five bile acids and the d4-IS were recorded using the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The peak areas were extracted from MRM peaks using Skyline software version 4.2.0.. Absolute bile acid concentrations were calculated using the ratio between the peak areas of each bile acid and the d4-IS and the slope of the calibration curve built with bile acids standard compounds. Intra- and inter-assay CVs were 8.7 and 9.8, respectively.
All participants were offered the opportunity to provide a fresh stool sample on the day of their first blood draw for in vitro analysis. A subset of 9 participants were willing and able to provide a sample. The stool was collected in a plastic tub, and within 30 min, brought into a Bactron Anaerobic Chamber. Inside the chamber the stool was weighed and combined with anaerobic TCAP2 media (Table S1) to a final concentration of 1.66% wt:vol. The stool was broken apart with a spatula and further mixed with a stir bar and magnetic stir plate. The fecal suspension was then filtered through sterile cheesecloth and electronically pipetted into 50 mL glass serum bottles in triplicate (20 mL aliquots). The bottles were inoculated with SDG dissolved in 100% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to a final concentration of 6.55 µM SDG or left un-spiked (blank control). The bottles were capped with rubber stoppers and fitted with aluminum seals. The bottle headspace was replaced with 100% high-purity N2 for 10 min at the rate of 0.51.0 L/min. Bottles were placed in a rotating incubator (C24 Incubator, New Brunswick Scientific, Enfield, CT, USA) and incubated at 37 °C/300 rpm for 67 days.
Daily aliquots of fecal suspensions from individual incubating serum bottles were taken at approximately the same time every day using the anaerobic technique and stored at 20 °C in aliquots of 500 µL/day for lignan analysis and 100 µL/day for bacterial enumeration. Samples for DNA analysis were taken on Day 1 and 24 h of the incubation, and stored at 80 °C. The Day 1 sample was two pea-sized scoops of fresh stool dispersed in 5 mL sterile RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) collected in the anaerobic chamber during the previously described procedure. To collect the 24 h incubation pellet, fecal suspensions from serum bottles were combined in a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and spun down in a Beckman Coulter Centrifuge at 30 g/4 °C for 10 min, supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was re-suspended with 5 mL sterile RNAlater for storage. 
SECO, END, and ENL were measured by gas chromatographymass spectrometry in 24-h urine samples collected at the end of each intervention period. The lowest level of quantitation of the 3 analytes in 2 mL urine was 6.5 ng/mL. The mean intra- and inter-batch coefficients of variation for quality control samples were 5.1 and 9.5% for SECO, 8.0 and 11.3% for END, and 4.8 and 6.0% for ENL, respectively. The same method was used to measure these compounds in the in vitro incubations. For each time point, the measured metabolite concentration was divided by inoculated substrate concentration to calculate percent conversion.
Stool samples from the intervention collected in RNAlater were thawed and homogenized and two subsamples were extracted for DNA following previously published protocols. We also extracted RNA and DNA from both the 24-h of the in vitro incubations and the stool used as an inoculum for the incubations. Total RNA was extracted after the addition of synthetic internal standards and bacterial mRNA was enriched. The quality of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). mRNA amplification was performed using MessageAmpII (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA). cDNA was generated after addition of an in vitro transcribed internal standard.
Participant stool samples from the baseline and end of each intervention period were analyzed by paired-end sequencing of the V1V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, using the 27F mod forward PCR primer sequence 5-AGRGTTNGATCMTGGCTYAG-3 and the 519R reverse PCR primer sequence 5-GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3 as described. Sequencing was performed (Molecular Research, Shallowater, TX, USA) on the MiSeq using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 following the manufacturers guidelines to obtain 2  300 bp paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). FastQ files were exported and securely transferred to Fred Hutch (BaseSpace, Illumina) for bioinformatic analysis. To classify bacterial taxonomy, sequences were processed using QIIME v 1.9, as previously published, except that we used SILVA (release 132), and OTU picking was implemented in Vsearch.
Sequence reads were processed for bioinformatic analysis of the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes with the KneadData v 0.5.1 quality control pipeline, which uses Trimmomatic (version 0.36), BMTagger filtering, and decontamination algorithms to remove low-quality read bases and host (human) reads, respectively. Trimmomatic was run with parameters MAXINFO:80:0.5 and MINLEN:50. Functional profiling was performed using HUMAnN2 version 0.11.2 with reads de-paired and implementing Diamond to map reads against UniRef90. Sequences per gene family were counted, normalized for length and alignment quality, and linked to pathways using MetaCyc. For each participant, data matrices of the abundance of genes, gene families, and genes in metabolic pathways were evaluated. 
Of the 55 bile acids assayed, 20 had sufficient concentrations to be reliably quantitated and retained for analysis. For one individual, all three time points for muricholic acid were below the limit of detection. These observations were imputed with the equivalent of half the lowest concentration for this bile acid (0.25 nM). A very small value (1  104) was imputed for zero values for ENL (a total of 4). ENL was used for stratified analyses (below and above median: 22.1 µmol/24 h) and association analyses, as it was found to be the most informative metabolite in the parent study. Plasma bile acids and urinary ENL were transformed using the natural logarithm to improve the normality of distributions prior to analysis. 
Linear mixed models were used to (a) test the effects of the flaxseed intervention on individual bile acid concentrations; bile acid groups based on summing individual bile acids into categories of primary, secondary, glycine-conjugated, and taurine-conjugated; and stratified by low- and high-ENL excreters, as determined by below and above median excretion after the flaxseed extract intervention; and (b) cross-sectionally determine the association between plasma bile acids and ENL. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), intervention sequence, assay batch, and baseline bile acid concentrations. One outlier with high baseline values for most bile acids was excluded from intervention analyses but included in all cross-sectional analyses where the baseline was not included in the model. Because dietary fat may affect bile acid concentrations, we further evaluated the inclusion of mean dietary fat intakes at baseline. As point estimates did not differ, results are presented without its inclusion. Potential carryover effects were assessed by including terms for the intervention sequence and interaction of the intervention period. These terms were not found to be significant in any of the models. Cross-sectional analyses were additionally adjusted for intervention and were not adjusted for baseline bile acid concentrations or the intervention sequence. All associations were controlled for multiple testing using the BenjaminiHochberg algorithm, and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was considered significant.
There is a considerable overlap in the enzymatic reactions involved in metabolism of both lignans and secondary bile acids, i.e., hydroxylation/dehydroxylation, epimerization, and deconjugation reactions. Given the association between ENL and bile acids irrespective of treatment, we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the association between the gut microbial composition at the end of placebo, representing an individuals usual gut microbial composition, and 24-h urinary ENL excretion and individual bile acids at the end of the lignan intervention. A less conservative FDR of 10% was used for this analysis. Files of sequence counts for the gut microbiome were used in statistical analysis. To account for the compositional nature of the microbial genera abundances (n = 147), we calculated the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation. Microbial DNA extracted from two participants did not pass quality control, leaving a sample of n = 44 for this analysis. All analyses were performed using Stata (StataCorp v16, College Station, TX, USA). 
The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of the in vitro samples resulted in an average of 8.8 (3.5) and 9.4 (2.7 M) sequences before quality control (QC) and 8.8 (3.5) and 9.2 (2.7 M) after QC. The average read length was 142 bp (5). We analyzed both genes and transcripts of genes involved in secondary bile acid production in the stool and in vitro incubations of individuals that produce ENL. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples were assessed at 24 h of the in vitro incubations and in stool samples used for the inoculum in the incubations. An overview of the relative abundance of genes and transcripts was expressed as a relative percent of the total number of secondary bile acid genes in the stool or in vitro samples. To normalize gene expression, we used the ratio of reads per thousand (RPK) counts of metatranscriptome to metagenomic sequences (RNA/DNA) from enzymes involved in secondary bile acid metabolism including 7  and  hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (DHSH), 12  DHSH, and the bile acid-inducible (bai) gene cluster (summed across all genes in the cluster) (Table 1). Further, we assessed the relationship between the bacterial expression of genes involved in secondary bile acids in the in vitro assays and gene expression of genes involved in secondary bile acid production with baseline measurements of SECO, ENL, and END from the sample participants.
