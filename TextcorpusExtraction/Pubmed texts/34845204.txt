All relevant ethical regulations for work with human participants were followed, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The protocol was approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board, and an independent data monitoring committee reviewed patient safety.
We performed a retrospective, exploratory analysis of fasting plasma samples from the Surgery or Lifestyle with Intensive Medical Management in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SLIMM-T2D) clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov:NCT01073020), in which 38 individuals with T2D and obesity were randomized to RYGB using standard operative protocols (n=19) or nonsurgical intensive diabetes weight management (DWM; n=19) and followed longitudinally for 3 years; pre-specified primary study outcomes were previously reported. Metabolic assessments were performed at baseline (pre-randomization) and repeated at the 3 month time point (defined as achieving 10% of initial body weight loss or at 3 months, permitting assessment at similar weight loss in both groups) and at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.
Blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast and analyzed for HbA1c, plasma glucose, lipids (Quest Diagnostics), and insulin (Mercodia ELISA); additional aliquots were stored at 80°C and used for the current analysis. Samples with HbA1c were available from 19, 19, 19, 17, 16, and 15 participants from the RYGB arm, and 19, 19, 18, 11, 10, and 10 participants from the DWM arm at the baseline, 3, 12, 18, 24, and 36 month time points. Groups were metabolically similar at baseline.
Meal tolerance and 6min walk testing were performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months as described. In brief, Ensure (9g protein, 40g carbohydrate, 6g fat) was consumed over 5min, and blood was sampled at 30, 60, and 120min. Insulin sensitivity was calculated by HOMA-IR, while insulin secretion was calculated as the change in insulin from 0 to 30min during the meal test.
Plasma proteome profiling was performed using the high-throughput DNA aptamer-based SOMAscan assay platform (SomaLogic, Inc.). The abundance of 1129 proteins (enriched for extracellular proteins) was quantified as relative fluorescent units (RFU), normalized, calibrated, and log2-transformed. Samples were available at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36 month time points for 19, 19, 19, 15, and 14 participants in the RYGB arm, and for 19, 19, 16, 10, and 9 participants in the DWM arm (Supplementary Data 1).
Selected proteomic data were validated by ELISA in a subset of fasting plasma samples, including IGFBP2 (22-BP2HU-E01, ALPCO, NH), CNDP1 (F34010, LifeSpan Biosciences, WA), growth hormone (DGH00, R&D Systems, MN), and total IGF-1 (DG100, R&D Systems, MN). RBP4 and TTR were assayed by quantitative western blotting using polyclonal anti-human RBP4 (Dako) and anti-human TTR (Dako) with standard curves of purified human RBP4 or TTR (Sigma) on each blot. Changes per individual over time were tested for positive correlation to corresponding SOMAscan changes with a one-sided test of Pearson correlation.
Plasma metabolomics were profiled using a commercial semi-quantitative mass spectrometry-based platform (Metabolon, Inc.) as described. In brief, samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company. Several recovery standards were added prior to extraction for QC purposes. To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The organic solvent was removed using the TurboVap (Zymark); after overnight storage under nitrogen, samples were reconstituted in solvents prior to separation using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) with scan range 701000m/z. Each reconstitution solvent contained a series of standards at fixed concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. Raw data were extracted, and peaks were quantified by area-under-the-curve.
The majority of metabolites were identified by confirming a structure with a minimum of two orthogonal properties (here, an accurate mass m/z, accurate mass fragmentation, and a retention time) from a pure reference standard acquired under identical analytical conditions. These metabolites have confidence level 1, as per the Metabolomics Standard Initiative. Those metabolites not officially confirmed based on a standard have confidence level 3 and their biochemical name is marked with an asterisk (*) in the metabolite annotation (Supplementary Data 2 and 3); these are primarily lipids.
Quality control was ensured by assessment of instrument and process variability, determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the (a) internal standards added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers, and (b) endogenous metabolites present in 100% of technical replicates of a large pool of extensively characterized human plasma. Values for median RSD for instrument and process variability were 5 and 9%, respectively.
This dataset had 17% of values missing, and the metabolite average abundance from non-missing values was strongly negatively correlated with the metabolites proportion of missing values (Spearman rho=0.59, p<1015). This indicated that missingness is abundance-dependent, i.e., data were missing not at random (MNAR). For MNAR data, potential imputation approaches include imputing half of the minimum abundance per metabolite (HM) and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC), which imputes the left-censored data by randomly drawing values from a truncated normal distribution.
Metabolites that had missing values in more than 85% of samples were filtered out, leaving the dataset with 10% missing values. Missing values were imputed with HM, and abundance values were log2-transformed. Samples were available at baseline, 3, 12, and 36 months from 19, 18, 19, and 13 participants in the RYGB arm and from 19, 18, 16, and 9 participants in the DWM arm. Metabolomics were not profiled at 24 months due to cost. Metabolomics data are provided in Supplementary Data 3.
To test differential abundance of log2 normalized analytes between groups at baseline, we applied two-sided moderated t-tests with the R package Limma, and accounted for multiple hypothesis testing by controlling the FDR with the BenjaminiHochberg method. We analyzed proteins and metabolites separately. Limma applies linear regression modeling with empirical Bayesian methods to improve each analytes variance estimation using analytes shared systematic variance. At post-baseline time points, we calculated change in analyte abundance from baseline for each individual, and then applied moderated t-tests to test if these changes varied by group. We repeated these post-baseline analyses accounting for each persons BMI change as a covariate.
Significance for this and other analyses of high-throughput data (either from SOMAscan or Metabolon) was defined as FDR<0.15. However, significance for analytes measured without high-throughput platforms, such as clinical data (e.g., BMI) or proteins analyzed by ELISA, was defined as p<0.05.
To test the correlation of top metabolites to top proteins, we tested the correlation of baseline-corrected changes, and chose top analytes as those shown in the heatmaps in Fig. 2a, b.
To identify differentially abundant pathways, we constructed an integrated dataset of proteins and metabolites for samples that had both data types, where we averaged SomaLogic probes that had identical gene symbols. We applied Limmas Roast method to this dataset against Small Molecule Pathway Database pathways. We were interested in pathways that change, even if, for example, proteins tend to increase and metabolites tend to decrease, so we reported statistics from Roasts Mixed test, which tests if a pathways analytes tend to change without regard to direction (i.e., if analyte changes have large absolute values), so a pathway can be significant even if some analytes go up and others go equally down.
To plot top nodes in a network, we plot the most significant analytes as nodes with edges between them from the Pathway Commons network version 9. When disconnected nodes can be easily connected, we add less significant or unmeasured intermediates. Nodes are colored by their t-statistics, which had sufficiently high degrees of freedom to approach z-scores, and were labeled as such.
In plots of individual analytes with standard error of the mean (SEM), ordinary (i.e., unmoderated) SEM are displayed.
We tested mediation of each clinical variable with the causal chain: group  clinical variable change  clinical outcome change. We tested each clinical variables mediation by defining group as a binary variable representing RYGB or DWM per individual; clinical variable change as each clinical variables change between baseline and the 3 month time point per individual; and clinical outcome change as the change in clinical outcome between baseline and 12 months per individual.
We tested mediation of analytes with the causal chain: group  analyte change  clinical outcome change, with analyte change as each analytes change (on the log2 scale) between baseline and the 3 month time point per individual and the clinical outcome change as the change between baseline and 12 months (or in some cases later time points). As a comparison to Hitman, we similarly tested the mediation of analytes using the joint significance method and using the counterfactual approach with the mediation package in the R software. In our simulations to evaluate methods, the number of significant simulations was compared statistically with a two-sided Fisher exact test in the R software. We tested these Hitman results against pathways from the Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB) with the CAMERA pre-ranked pathway analysis method from the Limma package.
The study complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) and Joslin Diabetes Center Animal Care and Use Committees. Rat bariatric surgery was performed in high fat diet (HFD) fed male mice as described. Liver tissue was dissected 8 weeks postoperatively and flash-frozen for subsequent RNA extraction.
Primary hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type C57Bl6 male mice at age 8 weeks. After anesthesia (pentobarbital, 50mg/kg), the vena cava was cannulated (30G) and the portal vein was cut for drainage. The liver was perfused for 5min with 20mL of perfusion solution (NaCl 140mM, Tricine 25mM, KCl 5.5mM, EGTA 0.5mM, KH2PO4 0.5mM, Na2HPO4 0.3mM, pH 7.4) and then for 5min with 25mL of digestion buffer (Eagles balanced salts (NaCl 115mM, NaHCO3 25mM, D-Glucose 5.5mM, KCl 5.5mM, CaCl2 0.3mM, Na2HPO4 0.8mM, MgSO4 0.8mM), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and collagenase type II) for 5min. The liver was harvested and minced; the cell suspension was filtered through a 100 m cell strainer; cells were collected via centrifugation (200  g, 3min), and the pellet was resuspended in 15ml of complete DMEM (glucose 450mg/dL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cell suspension was mixed with 10ml of Percoll and centrifuged at 340  g, 10min); the pellet was resuspended in 25mL complete DMEM, centrifuged again (200  g, 5min), and resuspended in 10mL complete DMEM. Cells were counted and seeded at 1105 cells/mL onto collagen-coated plates.
Pools of four siRNAs targeting GHR or non-targeting controls (Horizon-Dharmacon) (final concentration 20nM) were added to a mixture of OptiMEM (Gibco) and transfection reagent (DharmaFECT, 15l per 1ml OptiMEM); the mixture was added to collagen-coated wells (200L/well) and incubated for 20min at room temperature (RT). Freshly isolated primary hepatocytes (n=6 in si-GHR; n=6 in non-targeting controls) were added to each well (800L/well), and medium containing siRNA and transfection reagents was replaced after 24h.
At 48h post-seeding, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4h, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 2h with DMEM containing glutamine, sodium lactate, and sodium pyruvate, in the presence or absence of pCPT-cAMP (100M, Sigma) and/or 10nM insulin. After 2h, the supernatant was collected, centrifuged twice (200  g, 3min, 340  g, 3min); 50L of the supernatant were used for glucose quantification (Thermo). The attached hepatocytes were washed once with PBS and frozen in 80°C.
RNA from primary hepatocytes and liver tissue was extracted using TRIzol reagent using the manufacturers protocol. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, ThermoFisher-Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green qPCR Supermix (Biorad) and QuantStudio 6 (Applied Biosystems). Primers are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Gene expression was quantified using the ddCt method.
