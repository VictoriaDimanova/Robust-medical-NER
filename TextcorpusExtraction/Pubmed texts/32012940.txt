Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical University of Graz (approval reference number 29319 ex 16/17, 29.06.2017) and all women provided written informed consent. Placentas for feto-placental endothelial cell (fpEC) isolation were collected from pregnancies of non-smoking (self-reported) women with a negative 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) performed at 2528 weeks of gestation, free from any medical disorders or pregnancy complications. Control placentas were obtained from women with a pre-pregnancy BMI < 25, overweight placentas were collected from women with a pre-pregnancy BMI > 25. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the fpEC donors.
For the collection of umbilical cord blood serum, the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. Umbilical cord blood was collected directly after delivery, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the serum was then stored at 80 °C. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the cord blood donors.
Primary arterial feto-placental endothelial cells (fpEC) were isolated from the collected placentas following a standard protocol. Briefly, chorionic arteries were dissected and endothelial cells isolated by perfusion with a collagenase/dispase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) solution. Cells were resuspended in endothelial basal medium (EBM, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with the EGM-MV BulletKit (Lonza) on 1% (v/v) gelatin-coated flasks. Isolated fpECs were grown at 37 °C and 12% oxygen, and used up to passage 10. Cells were characterized by immunocytochemical analysis (c.f. below) with positive staining for the endothelial cell markers VWF (von Willebrand factor) and CD31, and negative for the SMA (smooth muscle actin) and the fibroblast marker CD90. For isolation of RNA, protein, and collection of supernatant, cells were grown in 75 cm flasks to approximately 90% confluency, washed with ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Runcorn, United Kingdom), and harvested as described below.
Immunohistochemical staining of MME was performed on standard formalin-fixed paraffin embedded term placenta sections (5 µm). Standard deparaffinization procedure was followed by boiling slides in Epitope Retrieval Solution pH 9.0 (Novocostra, Leica, Vienna, Austria) for 7 min at 120 °C in a decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA). Sections were immunostained using the UltraVision horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Polymer Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase was blocked using the hydrogen peroxidase block for 10 min. Three washing steps with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) were followed by background blocking using Ultra Vision Protein Block for 5 min. Monoclonal mouse anti-CD10 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted at 1:2000 in Antibody Diluent (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and incubated on slides for 45 min at RT (room temperature). Slides were washed and detection achieved by incubation with the anti-mouse/rabbit UltraVision HRP-labelled polymer system (15 min) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbacole (AEC, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturers instructions. Nuclei were stained with Haemalaun solution (Sigma, St. Lois, MO, USA) and slides were mounted with aqueous mounting agent Aquatex (Merk Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). For negative controls, slides were incubated with the same concentration of unspecific mouse IgG1 (Dako) as the primary antibody. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with an AxioCamHRc digital camera.
Immunocytochemistry for quality control of fpEC and for MME was performed according to the same protocol. Cells (100,000 cells per 1.7 cm2 chamber) were grown on chamber slides for 48 h, washed with HBSS, and fixed with ice-cold acetone (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 3 min. Slides were rehydrated in Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) pH 7.5 with 0.1% Tween (Sigma) for 3 min, which was also used as a washing puffer. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with UltraVision Protein Block for 10 min. Subsequently, the primary antibody for endothelial cell markers VWF (anti-VWF A0082, Dako; 1:3000) and CD31 (anti-CD31 MON6002-1, clone EN4, Monosan, Uden, the Netherlands; 1:300), smooth muscle cell marker SMA (anti-SMA M0851, clone 1A4, Dako, 1:200), fibroblast marker CD90 (anti-CD90, DIA100, clone AS02, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; 1:200), and MME (anti-CD10; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:100) diluted in Dako antibody diluent was applied for 30 min. Negative controls were of the same isotype and in the same dilution (Dako). After three washings, slides were incubated with HRP polymer for 15 min in the dark and washed again. Then, chromogenic reaction was started by addition of peroxidase-compatible chromogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min. After washing in distilled water, nuclei were stained with hematoxylin and mounted with Aquatex.
Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quality and integrity of the RNA was determined by the ratio of spectrophotometric absorbance 260 nm/280 nm measured with the Scandrop 250 (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany). Complementary DNA was transcribed from 1 µg of total RNA using miScript II RT kit and 5 miScript HiFlex Buffer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions.
For the quantification of MME mRNA in primary fpEC, 3 ng/µL of cDNA was used per reaction in a total reaction volume of 20 µL in a CFX96 cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). RT-qPCR for MME was performed using the TaqMan assay Hs00155310_m1 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) for MME, and Hs02800695_m1 and Hs00265497_m1 (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1) and ribosomal protein L30 (RPL30), respectively) were used as housekeeping genes. For the quantification of MME mRNA in different human organs, 40 ng of cDNA was used, which was transcribed from fpEC and purchased RNA from human tissues (Clonetech; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the comparison of gene expression between different organs, the housekeeping genes HPRT1 (Hs02800695_m1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA, Hs04194521_s1) were used. Mean expression of the housekeeping genes was used to normalize gene expression with 2Ct method.
Total cellular protein was extracted with RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche). Cell lysates (8 µg per lane) were applied to a gradient 420% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot Turbo Mini Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane, BioRad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad). After transfer, membranes were incubated with Ponceau S solution (Sigma), which stained all transferred proteins. The membranes were photographed for protein normalization later. For detection of MME, mouse monoclonal anti-CD10 antibody (clone SN5c, Abcam, CA, USA) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000; R&D Systems). Signals were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For control of antibody detection, membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti--actin (1:20,000; clone AC-15, Abcam) followed by incubation with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000). MME signals were detected at 85 kDa and normalized to the Ponceau S-stained proteins in the molecular range between 40 and 100 kDa. Normalization of signals was performed with the signal intensity and was calculated by DigiDoc 1000 software.
For the collection of supernatants, fpEC were seeded (15,000 cells/cm2) in T25 flasks and cultured for 48 h. Then, supernatants were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and frozen at 80 °C until the experiment. Absorbance of medium without cells incubated the same way was substracted from MME levels measured in the conditioned medium. Cord blood serum was obtained as described above. The human Neprilysin (MME) ELISA kit (Abnova, Taoyvan City, Taiwan) was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. A total of 100 µL of cell culture supernatants diluted at 1:4 and 100 µL of cord blood serum were applied. Optical density was determined at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (SPECTRO Analytical Instruments, Kleve, Germany).
To test the effect of hypoxia or TNF on MME protein expression, fpEC (n = 7 different cell isolations, in duplicates) were seeded in gelatin coated 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well). Then, culture plates were placed at different oxygen concentrations (21%, 12%, and 5%) for 48 h. For TNF treatment, after overnight culture, cells were treated with TNF (5 and 50 ng/mL, Reliatech, Wolfenbttel, Germany) for 24 h. Cells without TNF treatment served as the control. Protein was extracted with RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (complete), and immunoblotting for MME was performed as described above.
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc). After testing for normal distribution (KolmogorovSmirnov test), Students t-test and Pearsons test were applied to detect differences between the control and overweight samples and correlations, respectively. p-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
