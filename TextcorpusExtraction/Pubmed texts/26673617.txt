Candidate microRNAs that showed aberrant expression in the remnant microenvironment and were possibly related to aggressive oncologic outcomes were identified using clinical samples of the proximal resection margin tissues and microarray analysis. Positive control samples (n = 4) were obtained from R1 resection cases (microscopically tumor-present in the resection margin) with poor oncologic outcomes (died of cancer recurrence), and the volume of tumor cells was found to be less than 10% of the entire tested area. We reasoned that these controls were appropriate for investigating the potential molecular changes within the surrounding microenvironment, in which low numbers of tumor cells may have survived, interacting with resident cells of the remnant microenvironment. Negative control samples (n = 4) were obtained from cases of R0 resection (microscopically tumor-free resection margin) with a favorable clinical outcome (survived without any event during a follow-up time of more than 5 years). Detailed clinicopathological information on the control cases is provided in the supplementary information and Supplementary Table S1.
Total RNA for microarray experiments was extracted (GENOCHECK Ltd., Seoul, Korea) using two slices of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections dissected at a thickness of 10-mm. The quality and quantity of RNA were checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and determined to be appropriate for microarray expression analysis. Microarray analysis was performed using Agilent Human miRNA arrays (8x60K v16.0, Agilent Technologies), which contained probes specific for 1205 human and 144 human viral miRNAs. Candidate miRNAs were selected when the expression level of an individual miRNA differed significantly (P-value < 0.05) between the positive and negative controls and the fold change was >1.5 based on comparison of the mean values of the positive and negative controls (Supplementary Data Set 1).
The expression pattern of selected candidate miRNAs in the microenvironment was analyzed in the set of proximal margin tissues obtained from 140 advanced gastric cancer cases. These cases had undergone radical surgery and curative R0 resection (tumor-negative in the proximal and distal resection margin lines). Standard gastrectomy, which included resection of at least two-thirds of the stomach and D2 lymph node dissection, was performed by gastric surgery specialists at Gangnam Severance Hospital between 2005 and 2008. No preoperative treatment was performed. The histopathology for each case was reviewed by pathologists. The median follow-up period was 67.4 months (range, 0.7 to 101.8 months). Clinicopathological details are described in the supplementary information and Supplementary Table S5. For negative controls, we used proximal resection margin tissue samples from 10 cancer-free individuals who had undergone gastrectomy at Gangnam Severance Hospital between 2005 and 2008 due to an ulcer or other benign inflammatory lesion.
FFPE tissues submitted as the proximal margin section were prepared under the conventional surgical and pathologic examination protocols (Figure 1). The tested area was histologically confirmed to be tumor-free on microscopic observation. RNA, including microRNA, was isolated using the miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNAs were synthesized using looped reverse transcription primers specific to each miRNA species. Looped reverse transcription and forward and reverse primers for each microRNA (hsa-miR-223-3p, -142-5p, -146b-5p, -150-5p, -363-5p, -532-5p, -502-3p, -1244, and -132-5p, as well as a housekeeping gene, U6sn) are listed in Supplementary Table S6. Expression of miRNA species was assayed quantitatively. In brief, a 20 l mixture containing 2 l of cDNA, 2 U of i-Taq DNA polymerase (iNtRON, Seongnam, Korea), 2 l of 10X i-Taq reaction buffer (iNtRON), 2 l of 2.0 mM dNTP mixture (Takara, Japan), 1 l of 5 pmol/l forward primer, 1 l of 5 pmol/l reverse primer, 0.9 l of 5X SYBR Green (ROCHE, Switzerland), and 10.9 l of tertiary distilled water was prepared, and amplification was performed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) under the following conditions: denaturation at 94°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec and 66°C for 40 sec (fluorescence signal acquisition was performed during this phase). Immediately after amplification, melting curve analysis was performed. All samples were analyzed twice to confirm reproducibility. Using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System software (version 2.1; Applied Biosystems), the expression value (2ddCCT) of each case was normalized to the median expression value of negative controls. High expression was defined when the normalized value was >2 (fold-change > 2).
For the validated miRNA that had significant clinical implications, predicted target messenger RNAs were queried in a web-based database (http://mirecords.umn.edu/miRecords; http://www.microrna.org/microrna), and 27 highly relevant genes and three reference genes were selected to form a custom-based array set. FFPE tissues of the proximal resection margin section were selected from the above set of proximal resection margin tissues (n = 140). To create a positive control group, 24 cases with abnormal expression of the identified miRNA in the proximal resection margin tissues and a poor clinical outcome were selected randomly. For the negative controls, 24 stage-matched cases with no aberrant expression of the miRNA and a favorable prognosis were selected. After quality assessment of the extracted RNA, 12 cases from the positive control group and 23 cases from the negative control group were ultimately analyzed. Clinicopathological information on these control samples is summarized in Supplementary Table 7. Expression analysis was performed using nCounter Gene Expression Custom CodeSet (30 Genes  48 Reactions; NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Predicted target gene expression is summarized in Supplementary Data Set 2.
We investigated the expression of the target protein of the candidate miRNA in each cell type making up the microenvironment, using FFPE tissues from clinical samples.
Normal palatine tonsil tissues (n = 10), a set of non-tumor gastric tissues (n = 45), and a set of advanced gastric cancer tissues (n = 250) were included in the analysis. Tonsil tissues were obtained via tonsillectomy from cancer-free individuals. A set of normal gastric tissue (n = 45) was used as a control, representing a non-tumor gastric microenvironment. A set of gastric cancer tissues (n = 250) was used to analyze the tumor-embedded microenvironment. These gastric cancer tissues were obtained from surgical resection performed at Korea University Guro Hospital from 2002 to 2005. Details regarding this set of gastric cancer tissues are summarized in the supplementary information and Supplementary Table 8.
For comparative analysis, mature (peripheral) T cell lymphoma tissues (n = 30) and mature B cell lymphoma tissues (n = 30) were included as examples of activated immune cells. The subtypes were as follows: peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified, n = 15), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (n = 5), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 10), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 20), follicular lymphoma (n = 5), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 2), and marginal-zone B cell lymphoma (n = 3). All lymphoma tissue samples were reviewed by hematopathologists (SOY and WIY) based on current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.
Representative tissue sections of palatine tonsils and tissue microarrays for non-tumor gastric tissue, gastric cancer tissues, and lymphoma tissues were prepared.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using a Ventana Bench Mark XT Autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) and a LEICA BOND-III Autostainer (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK). Tested primary antibodies were as follows: NOVA1 (dilution 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CD68 (dilution 1:150; DAKO), CD20 (dilution 1:1600; clone L26; DAKO), CD3 (dilution 1:200; LabVision, Fremont, CA, USA),
CD4 (dilution 1:200; Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA), FOXP3 (dilution 1:100; Aviva Systems Biology, CA, USA), myeloperoxidase (dilution 1: 2000, DAKO), CD34 (dilution 1:50; clone QBEnd 10; DAKO), S100 (dilution 1:2000; DAKO), and alpha smooth muscle actin (dilution 1:500; clone 1A4; DAKO). Double staining with NOVA1/CD20, NOVA1/CD3, NOVA1/CD21, and NOVA1/CD68 was performed using palatine tonsil tissues for cellular localization of NOVA1 expression. Cell typing of immune cells and stromal spindle cells was also confirmed histomorphologically with H&E and immunohistochemical stains as follows: macrophages/monocytes/dendritic cells (CD68, S100, myeloperoxidase), B-lymphocytes (CD20), T-lymphocytes (CD3), regulatory T cells (FOXP3), neutrophils (myeloperoxidase), stromal spindle cells (Schwann cells, fibroblasts, support cells, and endothelial cells; S100, smooth muscle actin, and CD34).
Pathologists, including the hematopathologist, evaluated the cellular localization of NOVA1 expression for each cell type within the microenvironment under microscopic examination. NOVA1 expression scoring was semiquantitatively determined by staining intensity grade (1, no staining to weak intensity; 2, moderate intensity; 3, strong intensity) multiplied by the percentage grade of positive cell nuclei (1, 0%9%; 2, 10%19%; 3, 20%29%; 4,30%39%; 5, 40%49%; 6, 50%59%; 7, 60%69%; 8, 70%79%; 9, 80%89%; 10, 90%100%) after modifying the previously-used semiquantitative approach. The resulting NOVA1 protein expression scores ranged from 1 to 30 and were classified as having strong (21-30), moderate (11-20), or weak (1-10) expression.
Cell densities (number) of T cells and FOXP3-positive T cells were investigated according to NOVA1 expression in T cells. Using the set of gastric cancer tissues (n = 250), the densities of CD3-positive T cells and FOXP3+ T cells that had infiltrated the tumor microenvironment were counted as follows according to the method of our previous study: the five most representative 400-magnification high-power fields were selected. Preserved intact nuclei were counted manually, and the counted cell numbers were averaged.
Gastric cancer cell lines SNU-5 (00005; KCLB, Seoul, South Korea), SNU-16 (00016; KCLB) and SNU-620 (00620; KCLB) were purchased and maintained in RPMI1640 medium (22400-089, Gibco; Life Technologies, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (6000-044, Gibco; Life Technologies). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; CC-2517; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were purchased and maintained in EGM (CC-3124; Lonza), and human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF; CC-2511;Lonza) were purchased and maintained in FGM-2 (CC-3132; Lonza).
Scrambled control miRs (scrambled oligonucleotides for miR-146b-5p and miR-146b-5p inhibitors; AccuTarget¢ miRNA mimic Negative control; Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea), a hsa-miR-146b-5p mimic (Bioneer), and a hsa-miR-146b-5p inhibitor (Bioneer) were obtained and transfected at a concentration of 30 nM using lipofectamine reagent (L3000008, Invitrogen; Life Technologies). After 72 hours, cells were harvested. Experiments were performed independently three or more times. An Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay (FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit; BD Pharmingen, CA, USA) was performed to determine cell apoptosis or necrosis after transfection.
SNU16 cells were co-cultured with NHDF cells on 6-well plate polycarbonate membrane transwell inserts (Costa3412; Corning, MA, USA). After transfection of scrambled control miRs, the hsa-miR-146b mimic, and both the hsa-miR-146b mimic and the hsa- miR-146b-5p inhibitor, cells were co-cultured. After 72 hours, cells were harvested. Experiments were performed independently three or more times.
miRNA was isolated using a mirVana miRNA isolation kit (AM1560, Ambion; Life Technologies), and cDNA was constructed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (4366596, AB; Life Technologies) for miR146b-5p and U6. TaqMan probes used were as follows: has-mir-146b (001097, AB; Life Technologies) and U6 snRNA (001973, AB; Life Technologies). The average relative expression of miR146b-5p was determined by the comparative method (2ddCt). After RNA isolation using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (74134; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), cDNA was constructed using a cDNA synthesis kit (11754-050, Invitrogen). TaqMan probes used were as follows: GAPDH (Hs99999905-m1, AB; Life Technologies) and NOVA1 (Hs00359592-m1, AB; Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI StepOnePlus¢ (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling parameters: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. Relative mRNA expression levels of NOVA1 were determined by the comparative method (2ddCt).
The Mann-Whitney (MW) U test, one-way ANOVA, two-sample t-test, x2 test, and Pearson's or Spearman's correlation test were used to analyze the significance of differences among the variables examined. Overall survival times were measured from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up visit. Recurrence-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the first clinical, radiological, and/or histological evidence of recurrence in intraperitoneal or distant organs. Patient survival rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival rates were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. A two-sided P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 22 software for Windows (IBM Corp, Somers, New York).
