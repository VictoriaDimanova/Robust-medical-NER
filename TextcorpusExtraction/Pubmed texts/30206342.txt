A total of 30 generally healthy Belgian or Dutch women, scheduled for an aesthetic breast reduction, were recruited for this study; 20 of them were included in this epigenomics study. The exclusion criteria were breast cancer, antibiotic treatment within the previous month, and soy allergy. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Ghent University Hospital (EC UZG 2005/022). The volunteers were fully informed of the aims of the study and gave their written consent. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant local and national guidelines and regulations.
One batch of commercially available soymilk derived from whole soybeans in 250mL cartons (Alpro Soya Drink Nature, Alpro NV, Wevelgem, Belgium) was kindly provided by the manufacturer and analyzed in triplicate at study onset and closure as described by Bolca et al.. One portion of soymilk (250mL) contained 16.980.76mg genistein and 5.400.22mg daidzein aglycone equivalents, and 8.25g proteins, 7g carbohydrates, 4.75g lipids, 1.5g fibers, 0.375µg vitamin B12, 0.6µg vitamin B2, and minerals.
This study was a randomized dietary intervention trial with a run-in phase of at least 4 days and a supplementation phase of 5 days before breast surgery. Following eligibility assessment, volunteers were randomly allocated to the soymilk (n=10) or control (n=20, of which 10 included in the epigenomics study) group. All participants were asked to abstain from soy-based products during the whole experimental period. A detailed list of isoflavone-containing foods and dietary supplements was distributed in order to guide the volunteers in this respect. Additionally, subjects were instructed to report every case of doubt or fortuitous consumption and to provide detailed information on that eating occasion, including type and portion size. During the supplementation phase, 250mL soymilk was consumed daily with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The control group did not receive any supplementation before surgery. Compliance was evaluated by subject inquiry and urinary isoflavone excretion.
Subjects delivered a spot urine sample after the run-in phase and before anesthesia. During surgery (1218h after last soy supplementation), blood and breast biopsies were collected. Serum was obtained by centrifugation (10min at 600g, room temperature) after coagulation. Aliquots of both urine and serum samples were stored at 20°C until analysis. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C until analysis. Without thawing the tissue samples, fractions containing almost exclusively glandular tissue were dissected, based on gross inspection. Areas of adipose tissue intimately intermixed with fibroglandular tissue were avoided and connective tissue was removed. Before processing, all samples were randomized and the investigators were blinded to the treatments when working with the samples.
In addition, a general questionnaire was used to obtain information on the subjects history of antibiotic treatments, hormonal therapies, other medication, food supplement intakes, and anthropometric measures. Each participant reported her habitual fat and fiber intakes, and her soy consumption since birth using validated self-administered food-frequency questionnaires.
Genistein, daidzein, and equol were purchased from Extrasynth¨se (Genay, France), and dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin from Plantech UK (Reading, UK). For the hydrolysis of conjugated isoflavones, a 33g/L-solution of Type H-1 Helix pomatia extract (min. 300 U -glucuronidase/mg and 15.3 U sulfatase/mg; Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) in sodium acetate buffer (0.1mol/L, pH=5) was prepared. A 400 µmol/L and 40 µmol/L-solution of 4-hydroxybenzophenone in methanol was used as internal standard in the quantitative analyses of urine, serum, and breast tissue, respectively.
Genistein, daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin in urine were quantified upon enzymatic hydrolysis and liquid-liquid extraction, using a LC-MS method validated by Wyns et al.. Based on a creatinine clearance rate of 0.163mmol/(d.kg), daily urinary isoflavone excretions were calculated. Quantification of genistein, daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin, and the internal standard in hydrolyzed serum (200µL) and glandular tissue (250mg) was performed by LC-MS/MS according to Bolca et al..
Additionally, estrogens were extracted from glandular breast tissue (200mg) as described by Chetrite et al. and analyzed for 17-estradiol using a quantitative immunoassay (EIA-4499, DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany).
High-quality genomic DNA (gDNA) (2050kb; 11.04127.42ng/mg) was obtained from 22 mammary gland samples (10 soymilk, 10 matched controls, 2 technical replicates  one for each treatment group) using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). Briefly, 5085mg of manually dissected glandular tissue was lysed with proteinase K (20g/L) for 4h at 55°C and 300rpm. The lysate was centrifuged (3min at 17968g, room temperature) and treated with RNase A (20g/L in 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10mM EDTA; 2min at room temperature). The sample was purified through a silica-based membrane and gDNA was eluted twice with 50µL of water. DNA quantity and fragment length were measured using Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and 1% agarose gelelectrophoresis, respectively, and all samples were diluted to a final concentration of 500ng gDNA/75µL water.
MethylCap-seq is a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling methodology combining methyl binding domain (MBD) based capture of methylated fragments and subsequent massive-parallel sequencing, also known as MBD-seq. MethylCap-seq was performed by NXTGNT (Ghent, Belgium) as outlined earlier, with following modifications: (a) 500ng input material was used for the affinity purification step (MethylCap kit, Diagenode, Liege, Belgium), (b) paired-end (251 nt, excluding adapters and multiplex identifiers) massive parallel sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.
Global DNA methylation levels were assessed as previously reported. As a minimum amount of 1µg gDNA input was required, analyses were performed on the qualifying subset of 6 treatment and 5 control samples. In summary, gDNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed to deoxyribonucleosides and dissolved in LC-grade water. Similarly, stock solutions were prepared for reference standards of 2-deoxycytidine (dC) and 5-methyl-2-deoxycytidine (5-mdC), purchased from Sigma (D3897-1G) and Jena Bioscience (N-1044) respectively, to create a series of calibration standards, used in all of the experiments. Global DNA methylation was assessed by quantifying both 5-mdC and dC using Waters Acquity UPLC coupled to Waters Micromass Quattro Premier Mass Spectrometer (electrospray ionization in positive mode). Global DNA methylation was calculated as a percentage of 5-mdC versus the sum of 5-mdC and dC.
For MethylCap-seq, sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) with BOWTIE and aligned fragments were summarized using the in-house developed Map of the Human Methylome (http://www.biobix.be/map-of-the-human-methylome/). As previously described in e.g. Van Vlodrop et al., this map contains genomic regions that are putatively independently methylated, without relying on existing gene annotation. For each of these regions, the maximum number of mapped fragments (peak height) per sample was used for subsequent analysis (duplicate fragments removed). For annotation, we relied on Ensembl Genes 91. Unless mentioned otherwise, subsequent data analysis was performed using R (3.3.2).
For the exploratory analysis, the technical replicates were included and log-transformed counts per millions (log-cpm) values were calculated using the cpm function present in the R Bioconductor EdgeR package (version 3.16.5). Subsequently, the 10,000 loci with most variance were selected for hierarchical clustering (complete method on Euclidean distance matrix, using the hclust function).
For the statistical assessment of differential methylation, those technical replicates with the lowest overall coverage where removed from the analysis. Average log-cpm values were used to compare the genic-intergenic resp. promoter-genic methylation ratios between treatment groups. For the locus specific comparisons, only those loci featured by Gene Symbol annotation and an average coverage of at least 4 (prior to normalization) were used. This filtering step, aiming to remove uninformative variables from the data set, together with the removal of duplicate entries led to a final set of 759,275 loci out of a total of 3,618,706.
For the analysis of differentially methylated loci, the limma-voom model was used, since limma-voom presented considerably improved quality statistics compared to others (based on MA-plot and P-value distribution, data not shown). As is standard practice for limma-voom, TMM normalization (from EdgeR package) was performed on the filtered counts. Known to be often associated with gene expression, particularly promoter methylation is of interest, leading us to focus on the 49,378 promoter regions (2000 bp upstream to 500bp downstream of canonical transcription start site, based on Ensembl annotation) for the promotor specific differential methylation analysis.
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the goana function in the limma package. This package uses Entrez gene identifiers and can simultaneously report on the three main GO categories: biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. For gene set analysis, a P-value cutoff (P-value<0.0005) was used rather than a multiple testing adjusted cut-off given the general lack of significant results for the individual genes (see Results). Although individual loci considered are thus less reliable, this is putatively compensated by the higher number of actually differentially methylated loci, leading to increased power for the gene set analysis. Additionally, pathway analysis was investigated using the kegga function in the limma package. Cut-off criteria and P-value correction were performed analogously to the GO enrichment analysis.
LINE-1 methylation was evaluated by mapping (BOWTIE, loose parameter settings: L=5, e=100) both paired-end reads separately on the Homo Sapiens LINE-1 consensus sequence (L1HS) obtained from Repbase and counting the mapped reads. Duplicate reads were removed first using FastUniq. Paired-ends mapping both to L1HS were counted as a single event. L1HS count data were normalized for coverage differences by division by the total number of sequenced fragments.
Additional data analyses were performed in R (3.3.2) as well: the Student t-test was used to compare sequencing characteristics, LINE-1 methylation, and global DNA methylation between groups, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the comparison of 17-estradiol concentration and both genic-intergenic and promoter-genic methylation ratios between treatment groups, and Spearman correlation to evaluate the correlation between isoflavone concentrations and library sizes resp. locus-specific methylation degrees. Throughout the manuscript, Benjamin-Hochberg P-value adjustment was performed to correct for multiple testing, leading to False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimates.
