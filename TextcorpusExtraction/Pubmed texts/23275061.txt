The synthesis of LY2801653 is described in Example 1 of the patent.
The dissociation constant (Ki) value, mode of inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive) and the pharmacodynamic residence time (Koff) value of LY2801653 for the MET kinase activity were determined using radiometric-filter binding and spin column assays. Methods for these assays are described in detail in the Supplementary Methods section.
MET kinase domain (amino acid boundaries 10561364) was co-expressed with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and purified by Kinasia (Carmel, IN) similarly to previous work by Wang et al.. MET protein was purified by nickel affinity and MonoQ chromatography and concentrated to 8 mg/mL in 20 mM MES (pH 6.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, and 2 mM DTT. The buffer was adjusted to 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM n-dodecyl--D-maltoside for crystallization with 10 mg/mL MET incubated with 1 mM LY2801653 (1 % DMSO). Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C, with reservoir solution of 16 % PEG 10,000, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 % ethylene glycol, and optimized by microseeding. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20 % glycerol. Crystals of MET/LY2801653 belong to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a=40.51 , b=63.89 , c=111.63 . The diffraction data (1.8 , 99.7 % complete) were collected and processed on SGX-CAT beam line at APS in Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal structure was determined by the method of molecular replacement using 1 internal MET structure as a search model. The Flynn program (OpenEye Scientific Software) was used for ligand fitting and Coot was used in model building. Structure refinement (Rwork=0.216 and Rfree=0.249, RMSbond=0.009, RMSangle=1.218) was carried out by Refmac5. Protein Data Bank accession code for the co-crystal structure is 4EEV.
Inhibition of auto-phosphorylation of MET by LY2801653 was assessed in two cell lines by ELISA. One measured the HGF stimulated MET auto-phosphorylation of Y1349 in H460 cells. Another measured the MET auto-phosphorylation at Y1230/Y1234/Y1235 in NIH3T3-derived S114 cells engineered to stably express human MET and HGF. For details, see the Supplementary Method section.
Translocated promoter region-MET (TPR-MET) oncogene was cloned into the pLNCX2 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and various reported MET mutations in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma were introduced using the QuikChange¢ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). BaF3 cells are an immortalized murine bone marrowderived pro-B-cell line, the proliferation of which depends on the presence of IL3. These cells were transduced with retrovirus containing each of the TPR-MET mutation-bearing constructs as previously described. BaF3 cell lines expressing these MET mutations were confirmed with bidirectional DNA sequencing, using 3730xl DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media+10 % dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen # 26400-044) and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen # 15240-067). 4.5103 cells (-IL3) or 1.8103 cells (+IL3) (10 ng/mL, R&D Systems, # 403-ml) were plated onto 96-well plates, treated with LY2801653, and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. WST1 reagent (Roche, #11644807001) was added and incubated for 2 h; absorbance was read at OD450. The IC50 values were determined with the JOCKYSS program.
The specificity of the inhibitory activity of LY2801653 was determined using single-point or 3-point profiling and confirmatory 10-point or 11-point IC50 assays available at EMD Millipore Inc. (Dundee, UK), Cerep (Poitiers, France), or KinomeScan (DiscoveRx, San Diego, CA). These assays used active full-length or receptor tyrosine kinase domain enzymes, and peptide or protein substrates unique to each enzyme. Reactions were run at or near the Km for ATP to allow for direct comparisons of IC50 potency between the enzymes. For details, see the Supplementary Method section.
2103 DU145 cells/well on poly-D-lysine 96-well black/clear plates were treated with LY2801653 (in 0.4 % DMSO), immediately followed by the addition of human HGF (20 ng/ml), and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. 2 % formaldehyde fixed cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin (#A12379, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and counterstained with Propidium Iodide (# P3566 Invitrogen). Colony counts were quantified on Acumen Explorer¢ laser-scanning fluorescence microplate cytometer (TTP Labtech Ltd, Cambridge, MA). A colony was defined as¥4 cells.
Cell-based assays (anti-proliferative or inhibition of phosphorylation of target kinase) were performed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of LY2801653 against MST1R, AXL, ROS1, PDGFRA, MKNK1/2, FLT3, MERTK, TYRO3, TEK, KDR, CSF1R, RET, DDR1, DDR2. for details, see the Supplementary Method section.
All animal studies were performed in accordance with American Association for Laboratory Animal Care institutional guidelines. All in vivo experimental protocols were approved by the Eli Lilly and Company Animal Care and Use Committee. Athymic nude mice and CD-1 nude mice were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and Charles River (Wilmington, MA), respectively. In all in vivo studies, LY2801653 was formulated in 10 % acacia daily and dosed orally. The in vivo mouse studies explored the MET target inhibition and pharmacokinetics of LY2801653 in the S114 xenograft model; as well as the antitumor growth activity in xenograft (U-87MG, KP4, H441, MKN45, H1993, HT-29, and MV4-11) and in orthotopic (H1299) models. For details, see the Supplementary Method section.
U-87MG xenograft tumors were excised from mice after 28 days of dosing and placed into Zinc-Tris fixative (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), stained and quantified as previously described. For the apoptotic and proliferative markers, slides were stained with a combination of Hoechst 33324 (Invitrogen), rat anti-mouse CD31 (Pharmingen) /anti-rat Alexa-488 (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-Ki67 (NeoMarkers)/anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen), and TUNEL-TMR red (Roche). For the angiogenesis markers, slides were stained with a combination of Hoechst 33324, rat anti-mouse CD31/anti-rat Alexa-488, rabbit anti-glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Chemicon) /anti-rabbit Alexa 647, and mouse anti-Smooth Muscle Actin/Cy3 (Sigma).
