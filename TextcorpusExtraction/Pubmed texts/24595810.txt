Thirteen healthy men participated in the study (mean age  SEM: 22.62  0.86 years). All subjects had a regular sleep/wake pattern, did not take any medication at the time of the experiments, and were nonsmokers. Acute and chronic illness was excluded by medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory investigation. The men were synchronized by daily activities and nocturnal rest. All subjects spent one adaptation night in the laboratory in order to become accustomed to the experimental setting. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Lbeck and all participants gave written informed consent.
The study was performed according to a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. Each participant spent two experimental nights in the sleep laboratory (placebo versus fludrocortisone). The two nights were separated by at least 2 weeks to assure clearance of the drug. The order of conditions was balanced across subjects. On experimental nights, subjects arrived at the laboratory at 19:30 h for preparing blood sampling and polysomnographic recordings. Between 21:40 and 22:30 h subjects performed on psychological tasks, results of which (as part of an extended subject sample) are reported elsewhere. Sleep was allowed for a 7 h period starting around 23:00 h (lights off;  30 min). Subjects received either 0.2 mg of fludrocortisone (Merck Serono GmbH, Germany; peak plasma concentration after 1.7 h; biological half-life 1836 h) or placebo orally right before lights were turned off.
Blood was sampled first 90 min and immediately before drug administration, and then every 45 min until 90 min after awakening for determination of cortisol, ACTH, and aldosterone levels. T-cell parameters were determined in blood sampled 90 min before drug administration and then every 1.5 h until 45 min as well as 90 min after awakening. Blood was sampled via an intravenous forearm catheter, which was connected to a long thin tube and enabled blood collection from an adjacent room without disturbing the subject's sleep. To prevent clotting, approximately 700 mL of saline solution were infused during the experimental period. Potential side effects of fludrocortisone were evaluated in the morning by questionnaires. Standard polysomnographic recordings were obtained to assure normal nocturnal sleep. Blood pressure was assessed before subjects went to sleep and again in the morning.
Absolute counts of CD3+ total T lymphocytes, CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as their na¯ve (CD45RA+CD62L+), central memory (CD45RACD62L+), effector memory (CD45RACD62L), and (terminally differentiated) effector (CD45RA+CD62L) subsets were determined by a lyse no-wash flow cytometry procedure. Briefly, 50 L of an undiluted blood sample was immunostained with anti-CD3/Horizon V500, anti-CD8/PerCP, anti-CD4/Horizon V450, anti-CD62L/FITC, anti-CD45RA/PE, and anti-CD184 (CXCR4)/allophycocyanin, in Trucount tubes (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, 0.9 mL of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) lysing solution (BD Biosciences) was added followed by incubation for 15 min. Finally, samples were mixed gently and at least 10000 CD3+ cells were acquired on a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer using DIVA Software (BD Biosciences). The absolute number of cells per microliter blood was calculated using the following formula: Cells/L = (acquired cell events in the respective gate)  (number of beads per tube)/((acquired bead events)  (sample volume (L))). To study changes in relative quantity of CD184 (CXCR4) and CD62L (l-selectin) on the cell subsets, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the labeled anti-CD184- and anti-CD62L-antibodies was analyzed.
Samples for measuring hormone concentrations were kept frozen at 80°C until assay. Serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, and serum aldosterone were measured using commercial assays (cortisol, ACTH: Immulite, DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany; aldosterone: IBL International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Sensitivity was as follows: cortisol 0.2 g/dL, ACTH 9 pg/mL, aldosterone 10 pg/mL. Intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation for all assays were < 10.4%. Sleep stages were determined off-line from polysomnographic recordings following standard criteria, and confirmed that sleep architecture was normal under laboratory conditions and was not significantly affected by fludrocortisones administration (see also).
Whole blood from additional 13 healthy subjects (mean age  SEM: 23.46  0.71 years) was sampled during early sleep (at 03:30 h). To test the influence of fludrocortisone and spironolactone on the expression of CXCR4, CD62L and CCR7, blood samples were incubated with PBS at 37°C in the absence or presence of 6.7 nM fludrocortisone (representing expected peak blood concentration after oral intake of 0.2 mg fludrocortisone), 5 M spironolactone (MR antagonist) or both drugs in combination for 2 and 4 h. Samples were then labeled with anti-CD3/Horizon V500, anti-CD4/Horizon V450, anti-CD62L/FITC, anti-CD45RA/Alexa Fluor 700, anti-CD184 (CXCR4)/allophycocyanin, and anti-CD197 (CCR7)-PE (all from BD Biosciences), and anti-CD8/Qdot 605 (Invitrogen), and subsequently processed via a lyse no-wash flow cytometry procedure as described for the in vivo experiments.
Data are presented as mean  SEM. Analyses generally relied on ANOVA including repeated measures factors for Treatment (fludrocortisone versus placebo) and Time (reflecting the different time points of the observation period). Differences between conditions in baseline measures (i.e., the first two blood samples) were used as covariates to correct for day-to-day variations in flow cytometer performance and baseline differences. Degrees of freedom were corrected using the Greenhouse-Geisser procedure. Paired t-tests were applied to analyze post hoc differences at single time points once ANOVA indicated significant effects, to assess results of in vitro experiments, and to analyze differences in sleep parameters and blood pressure. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
