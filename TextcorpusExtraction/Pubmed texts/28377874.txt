A human exercise intervention trial (NCT01803568) was performed as described before. The National Committee for Research Ethics North (Troms¸, Oslo, Norway) approved the trial. This study adhered to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.
Briefly, 26 sedentary (<1 bout of exercise/week during the previous year) men aged 4065 y with BMI 26  4.0 kg/m2, were included in the trial. They were initially recruited to a control group (n = 13) with normal glucose metabolism and a dysglycemic group (n = 13) with fasting serum glucose ¥ 5.6 mmol/L and/or 2 h glucose ¥ 7.8 mmol/L based on an oral glucose tolerance test. Two subjects had normal glucose levels at screening, but both had a glucose infusion rate of 4.4 mg min1 kg1 during the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and were included in the dysglycemic group. Here we did not investigate group differences, and all subjects were therefore included (n = 26).
The participants underwent 12 weeks of supervised exercise training with two interval sessions (bicycle) and two whole-body strength-training sessions per week. Bicycle tests (45 min at 70% of VO2max) were conducted before and after the long-term training intervention. Blood samples and biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were collected before, immediately after, and 2 h after the acute bicycle tests (Figure 1A).
RNA was isolated from muscle biopsies and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. RNA integrity was determined using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Chips and a Bioanalyzer 2100. Deep sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system with multiplexed design. The cDNA was fragmented, and cDNA fragments with 51 bp nucleotides were selected and amplified. Tophat 2.0.8 with Bowtie 2.1.0 was used (with default settings) to align the RNA-seq reads against the UCSC hg19 annotated transcriptome and genome. EdgeR v3.4.2 was used for gene filtering, normalization, and calculation of p-values using a negative binominal generalized linear model in R v3.0.3 (R Core Team 2014). Correction for multiple testing was performed by using Benjamini-Hochbergs false discovery rate (FDR) control, set at FDR < 10%. The dataset generated from RNA-seq has been used in several other publications, including one study where gene expression data for extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were reported. To compare our data on CSF1 with other published data sets on skeletal muscle and exercise, we analyzed two data sets. Arrays were analyzed using the R package Oligo v1.36.1 following standard procedures for quality checks and calculation of normalized expression values using robust multi-array average. For differential gene expression analyses we used the LIMMA v3.20.9.
We selected all transcripts of single genes that were up- or down-regulated more than 1.5-fold after acute or long-term exercise training. Fast-responsive transcripts were up/down-regulated just after the acute bicycle test (A2/A1 and/or B2/B1, Figure 1AC), whereas slow-responsive transcripts were regulated after 2 h (A3/A1 and/or B3/B1, Figure 1A,D,E). The effect of long-term exercise training was assessed as the mRNA expression at B1 vs. A1 (Figure 1A,F).
To identify transcripts encoding secreted proteins, we used the MetazSecKB knowledgebase. MetazSecKB identifies secretory proteins based on either curated evidence of secretion (annotated and reviewed in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot dataset) or being highly likely to be secreted based on computationally predicted secretory protein sequences, without containing transmembrane domains or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals, by several tools (SignalP4, Phobius, TargetP and WoLF PSORT).
Biopsies from either m. obliquus internus abdominis or m. vastus lateralis from three male donors (age 3362 y) were used to isolate primary human satellite cells. Myoblasts were proliferated to passage 45 and differentiated. EPS (1 Hz, 2 ms, 11.5 V) was applied to the cells after 5 days of differentiation for 24 h or after 6 days of differentiation for 16 h. EPS should mimic muscle contraction similar to in vivo exercise. Supernatants were collected and RNA isolated for further analysis.
We measured CSF1 concentration in the supernatant of cultured myotubes and plasma samples using a human CSF1 ELISA Kit (DMC00B; R&D Systems Minneapolis; Minnesota, United States). Total protein concentration of plasma was measured by BC Assay (Protein assay kit, Uptima, Montlucon, France).
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Revers Transferase kit (ThermoFisher, Foster City, California, United States). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the CFX96¢ Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). The following pre-designed primers and probe sets were used (TaqMan assays; ThermoFisher, Foster City, California, United States) RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1), MTRNR2L4 (Hs04276154_s1), SMPDL3A (Hs00378308_m1), FAM20C (Hs00398243_m1), WNT9A (Hs00243321_m1), TEK (Hs00945155_m1), FLT1 (Hs01052961_m1), CSF1 (Hs00174164_m1), C8G (Hs01113922_g1), CHSY1 (Hs00208704_m1), IL4R (Hs00166237_m1), LCN10 (Hs01596612_g1), STC2 (Hs00175027_m1), THBS4 (Hs00170261_m1), IGFBP2 (Hs01040719_m1), KAZALD1 (Hs00368867_g1), TNFRSF25 (Hs00600930_g1), and SCT (Hs00360814_g1). Relative target mRNA expression levels were calculated as 2- Ct by normalizing to the expression of RPLP0.
