A total of 191 cases were enrolled and analyzed in this study. These cases included 51 patients diagnosed with MPS II since the 1990s in Taiwan, and 140 infants suspected of having MPS II after being screened by the Newborn Screening (NBS) Program for MPS. This screening program was established in Taiwan in August 2015, and all children suspected of having MPS were then referred to MacKay Memorial Hospital to confirm the diagnosis. The samples required for the assays included urine (1020 mL) and EDTA blood (2 tubes, 35 mL in each). Urine samples were stored at 20 °C prior to GAG analyses, and the blood samples were kept at room temperature and 4 °C before leukocyte isolation for enzymatic assay and molecular DNA analysis, respectively. All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committees on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2000. The Institutional Review Board of MacKay Memorial Hospital approved this study (14MMHIS281, approval date: 30 March 2015; 16MMHIS152, approval date: 22 June 2017; and 17MMHIS176, approval date: 30 August 2018), and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients or their parents.
Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions, from peripheral leukocytes of all patients. All IDS gene exons and flanking intronic regions were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase 2X Master Mix Red (containing Tris-HCl pH 8.5, (NH4)2SO4, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.2 units/µL Ampliqon Taq DNA polymerase, inert red dye and stabilizer; Ampliqon, Denmark), 10 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, and 75 ng of template DNA in a final volume of 30 µL. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 33 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 5862 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 40 s, and a final extension time of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBER green, and then visualized under a UV trans-illuminator. Sequencing of PCR products was performed at Genomics Inc. sequencing services (New Taipei City, Taiwan) on an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Plasmids expressing IDS protein were made by cloning the IDS cDNA into a pCMV6-Entry based Myc-DDK tagging vector (ORIGENE, RC219187) (Figure S1). Nineteen mutations of the IDS gene, including c.137C>A (p.D46A), c.142C>T (p.R48C), c.254C>T (p.A85V), c.311A>T (p.D104V), c.454A>C (p.S152R), c.589C>T (p.P197S), c.778C>T (p.P260S), c.797C>G (p.P266R), c.817C>T (p.R273W), c.851C>T (p.P284L), c.890G>A (p.R297H), c.998C>T (p.S333L), c.1106C>G (p.S369X), c.1025A>G (p.H342R), c.1400C>T (p.P467L), c.1402C>T (p.R468W), c.1403G>A (p.R468Q), c.1478G>A (p.R493H), and c.1499C>T (p.T500I) were introduced into the wild-type IDS cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Table S2 lists the primers used for site-directed mutagenesis. PCR was carried out with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 18 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 68ËC for 30 s followed by a final extension for 5 min. The reaction mixture contained 10 ng DNA template, 125 ng of oligonucleotide primers, 5 µL of 10X Reaction Buffer, 1 µL of dNTP, 1.5 µL of QuikSolution reagent and 1 µl of QuikChange Lightning Enzyme (QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing.
COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos MEM (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NJ, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NJ, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NJ, USA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The COS-7 cells were transfected by pCMV6-Entry plasmids of wild-type IDS cDNA and the 19 mutants using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufactures protocol. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested for IDS enzyme assays. These experiments were performed in triplicate.
Leukocyte enzyme assay for MPS II was described previously. The enzymatic liberation of fluorochrome from 4MU--L-iduronide-2-sulfate required the sequential action of IDS and -iduronidase. The rate of fluorescence increase was directly proportional to enzyme activity. Leukocyte isolation and protein determination were required prior to performing an enzyme assay. Leukocytes were isolated from EDTA blood by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 18 °C for 40 min at 2500 rpm. By removing the upper layer, the white cell ring from the interface was removed and transferred to a 5 mL centrifuge tube, followed by the addition of 0.9% NaCl to the top, mixing, and centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell lysates were prepared by suspending leukocyte pellets in 0.2 mL of 0.85% NaCl and disrupted by 6 cycles of freeze-thawing. Proteins were determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The assay for individual enzyme activity was performed using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrate, with the enzyme activity being proportional to the amount of liberated fluorescence detected (mol enzyme activity/g protein/hour). Individual enzyme activity, which was 5% lower than normal was defined as a marked reduction in that enzyme activity. The principle of the assay has been illustrated previously. The enzymatic liberation of fluorochrome from 4MU--L-iduronide-2-sulfate required the sequential action of IDS and -iduronidase, and a normal level of -iduronidase activity was insufficient to complete hydrolysis of the reaction intermediate 4-methylumbelliferyl--iduronide formed by IDS. In performing IDS enzymatic assay, at least one additional sulfatase is recommended to analyze to differentiate from multiple sulfatase deficiency. In our study, one additional enzyme, i.e., -L-iduronidase (IDUA), was analyzed by 4-MU fluorometric assay to ensure the quality assurance of the cell supernatant sample.
The Tandem mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; LC-MS/MS) (4000 QTRAP LC-MS/MS System; AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) assay for relevant GAG-derived disaccharides was performed using methanolysis for chondroitin sulfate (CS), DS and HS, and the mass to charge(m/z) of the parent ion and its daughter ion after collision was 426.1236.2 for DS and 384.2161.9 for HS. The quantities of urinary DS and HS were determined by applying the CS-normalized method reported by Lin et al., and the reference cut-off values were < 0.80 g/mL for DS and < 0.78 g/mL for HS.
The clinical signs and symptoms of MPS II were heterogeneous, and the disorder should be regarded as two broad groups, the severe and attenuated forms, according to the severity of symptoms and whether or not the patients are neuronopathic with intellectual disability. Neuronopathic with intellectual disability was assessed according to the scores for IQ and DQ tests and the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM) questionnaire for the parents. Individuals with attenuated MPS II were most often diagnosed between the ages of 4 and 8 years, and survival to adulthood was common. Patients with the more severe form of MPS II exhibited a chronic and progressive disease involving multiple organs and tissues. The age at diagnosis was usually between 18 and 36 months, and death from a combination of neurological deterioration and cardio-respiratory failure usually occurred in the mid-teenage years. Patients who underwent an HSCT or ERT could prolong their life and dramatically change the natural history of this disease. For this reason, it was mandatory to have a correlation between the severity of MPS II and genotype to decide the appropriate treatment.
Statistical analysis (Students t-test) was performed to compare values of IDS activity obtained from individual variants to those of the wild type. P values were calculated using Excel 2010 (Microsoft Office), and a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, a p-value < 0.01 was considered to be highly significant, and p-value < 0.001 was considered to be extremely significant.
