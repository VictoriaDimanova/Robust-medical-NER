This study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee and the Human Research Review Committee of Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital (No. 20140406). Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants prior to the start of the study. All the applied methods in the study were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.
All samples were collected at the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital between September 1, 2014 and September 1, 2016. None of the CRC patients included in this study had any other tumors or inflammatory colorectal disease such as colitis or infectious diseases, and none of the patients received chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to surgery. Pathological diagnosis was conducted by two different pathologists, and the clinicopathological stage of CRC was determined according to the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition).
48 serum samples were obtained from 24 paired pre- and post-operative CRC patients (mean age 65.83¯¯9.14; 54.2% male, 45.8% female), with their post-operative serum samples collected three days after surgery (Supplementary Table S1). 24 serum samples were obtained from patients with colorectal polyps (polyps have not been excised, mean age 60.22¯¯13.61; 58.3% male, 41.7% female) representing benign disease. 24 serum samples were obtained from healthy controls (mean age 63.77¯¯11.83; 50.0% male, 50.0% female). All serum samples were collected in 3¯mL vacuum tubes without anticoagulants and kept at 4¯°C for 1¯h. Samples were then centrifuged at 3000¯g for 20¯min at 4¯°C, distributed in 500¯L aliquots and stored at 80¯°C until use.
For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum samples were collected from 115 paired pre- and post-operative CRC patients (mean age 68.54¯¯7.01; 56.5% male, 43.5% female), 38 patients with colorectal polyps (mean age 60.03¯¯5.65; 55.3% male, 44.7% female), and 38 healthy controls (mean age 58.36¯¯10.54; 50.0% male, 50.0% female). Samples were processed and stored as described above.
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, tissue specimens were obtained from 176 CRC patients (mean age 67.22¯¯8.25; 58.5% male, 41.5% female), and 20 patients with colorectal polyps (mean age 61.16¯¯4.88; 60.0% male, 40.0% female). We obtained para-cancerous tissue from 20 CRC patients (mean age 65.55¯¯11.09; 50.0% male, 50.0% female). A portion of each tissue specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, then stored at 80¯°C until use, while the remaining tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and 4¯m slices prepared.
Two human colon cancer-derived cell lines (HCT116 and RKO) were included in this study. Authentication of human cell lines was achieved using short tandem repeats (STR, see Supplementary file). Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Israel) and 10¯mg/mL penicillin streptomycin (1%), and incubated at 37¯°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Serum samples were separated using MB-WCX (ClinProt purification reagent sets; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and a magnetic separator, with the magnet lowered, 5¯L serum samples were diluted in 10¯L binding solution in a standard thin wall PCR tube, added to 10 L of MB-WCX beads and then carefully mixed using the mixing feature of the robot. After thorough stirring, samples were incubated at room temperature for 5¯min, then the tubes were placed into the magnetic separator to collect the beads on the wall of the tube until the supernatant was clear (~1¯min). The supernatant was then removed and the magnet was lowered again. Following the stepwise application of sample and MB-WCX separation, we eluted the peptide fraction from the magnetic beads with 5¯L of elution solution and 5¯L of stabilization buffer. Eluted peptides were spotted onto the MALDI AnchorChip with 1¯L alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics) in 50% acetonitrile, and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added twice to the MALDI AnchorChip surface. Each sample was spotted in triplicate in order to evaluate reproducibility.
All samples were processed immediately on a calibrated Autoflex III MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics), using flexControl version 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics) with an optimized measuring protocol. A standard calibration mixture of peptides and proteins (mass range: 110¯kDa) was used for mass calibration. Tests were performed in a blinded manner, including serum analysis of different groups. Data analysis was performed by flexAnalysis version 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Recognition of peptide patterns was performed using ClinProTools version 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics). Data was processed by a standard workflow, which comprised of spectral pretreatment, peak selection, and peak calculation operations.
The peptides from plasma samples (the differential peptides are relatively abundant) were eluted from the magnetic beads and were analyzed by nano-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS using a nano Aquity UPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Samples of 20¯L (the sample was diluted by 2 times) were loaded on a C18 precolumn (SymmetryC18, 5¯m, 180¯m¯¯20¯mm, nanoAcquity¢Column) at 15¯L/min in 5% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3¯min. The precolumn was switched online with the analytical column (SymmetryC18, 3.5¯m, 75¯m¯¯150¯mm, nanoAcquity¢ Column) equilibrated in 95% solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 1.2% formic acid). Peptides were eluted using a 5% to 80% gradient of solvent B over 60¯min at a flow rate of 400¯nL/min.
The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to switch automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Full-scan survey MS spectra with 2 microscans (m/z 4002000) were acquired with the Q Exactive with a mass resolution of 100,000 at m/z 400, followed by 10 sequential LC-MS/MS scans. Dynamic exclusion was used with 2 repeat counts, 10¯s repeat duration and 60¯s exclusion duration. For MS/MS, charge state 1 was rejected and precursor ions were activated using 25% normalized collision energy at the default activation q of 0.25. The mass spectra were searched against the human Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/) using Maxquant software (Version 1.5.2.8). To reduce false positive identification results, a decoy database containing the reverse sequences was appended to the database. The parameters for the search were as follows: no enzyme, the variable modification was oxidation of methionine, peptide tolerance, 20¯ppm, MS/MS tolerance, 1.0¯Da. Positive protein identification was accepted for a peptide with Xcorr of greater than or equal to 3.20 for triply and 2.86 for doubly charged ions, and all with Cn¯¥¯0.1, peptide probability 2e-3.
Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Gene expression RNAseq dataset of TCGA derived from CRC (380 cancer and 51 normal), Esophageal cancer (184 cancer and 13 normal), Gastric cancer (415 cancer and 35 normal), Hepatic cancer (371 cancer and 50 normal), Pancreatic cancer (178 cancer and 4 normal), Lung cancer (1017 cancer and 110 normal) and Breast cancer (1097 cancer and 114 normal) were analyzed. Gene expression dataset of the GEO was analyzed by Metabolic gEne RApid Visualizer (http://merav.wi.mit.edu/SearchByGenes.html), included CRC (358 cancer and 19 normal), Esophageal cancer (6 cancer and 4 normal), Gastric cancer (15 cancer and 10 normal), Hepatic cancer (14 cancer and 7 normal), Pancreatic cancer (57 cancer and 16 normal), Lung cancer (116 cancer and 10 normal) and Breast cancer (332 cancer and 142 normal).
All serum samples were analyzed blindly, and standards and samples were tested in triplicate. The concentration of SETD7 was quantified using a Human SETD7 ELISA Kit (No. CK-E95510H, Shanghai Elisa Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density was tested at 450¯nm.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (4¯m) of CRC, para-carcinoma tissue and colorectal polyps were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SETD7 antibody (1:100, Proteintech Group, Cat# 248401-AP, RRID: AB_2737406). After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody and treated with 3,3-diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate buffer. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and then mounted on slides. SETD7 expression was analyzed using Image J.
si-RNA targeting human SETD7 and a negative control si-RNA were designed and synthesized by Genepharma (Genepharma, Shanghai, China). Transfection of each si-RNA (50¯nM) was carried out using Lipofectamine2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sequences of the si-RNA were as follows:
si-SETD71:
Sense: 5-GCAUCUACGAUAUGUUUGUTT-3, Antisense: 5-ACAAACAUAUCGUAGAUGCTT-3.

Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR analysis was used for relative quantification of SETD7 mRNA. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TAKARA, Japan). cDNA were amplified by real-time PCR on an IQ-5 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, USA) using SYBR green mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the primers as follows:
SETD7:
Forward: 5-CGAATTACACACCAAGAGGTT-3, Reverse: 5-TAGGCAACGGTGAGCTCTTC-3.
GAPDH:
Forward: 5-GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG-3, Reverse: 5-ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAA-3.
All reactions were run in triplicate. Data were analyzed by IQ-5 Series Software. Relative amounts of SETD7 mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The relative expression levels were calculated using the 2-Ct method.
SETD7 protein levels were quantified by Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts using the antibodies anti-SETD7 (1:1000, Proteintech Group, Cat# 248401-AP, RRID: AB_2737406) and anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Abcam, Cat# ab181602, RRID: AB_2630358). GAPDH served as a loading control.
For cell viability analysis, HCT116 and RKO cells were plated at a concentration of 5¯¯103 cells in each well of 96-well plates. After incubation for 24¯h, the cells were transfected with si-SETD7 at a final concentration of 50¯nM using Lipofectamine2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and viability was then was assessed using an MTT assay (Boster, Wuhan, China). For cell cycle analysis, HCT116 and RKO cells were plated at a concentration of 5¯¯105 cells per well in 6-well plates, and were transfected as above. After incubation for 48¯h, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 20¯°C. Then, cells were treated with RNase A and propidium iodide according to the protocol from the KGA Cell Cycle Detection Kit (Keygen, China). After incubation, the cells were assayed by flow cytometry (Becton, USA). For cell apoptosis analysis, cells were incubated for 48¯h following transfection then processed with an Annexin-V FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and examined by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using Modfit 3.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are shown as the mean¯¯standard deviation. P¯<¯.05 was considered statistically significant. Chi-square tests were applied to compare categorical variables. Two-tailed Student's t-tests and one-way ANOVA were used to compare quantitative data.
