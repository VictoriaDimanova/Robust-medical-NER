Human studies: detection of  OAS1, TBX21  and  IFNB  mRNA and IL-17A protein in PBMCs. Within the PreDicta study (Post-infectious immune reprogramming and its association with persistence and chronicity of respiratory allergic diseases) we analyzed two cohorts of children with and without asthma at the age of 46 years. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nrnberg, Germany (Re-No 4435). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants of this study (Study PreDicta, Registration number Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien (German Clinical Trials Register) DRKS00004914). We isolated PBMCs from the whole blood using Ficoll and density gradient centrifugation. After cell culture we analyzed them by ELISA and quantitative PCR. The clinical outcomes of the recruited children in this study are reported in Supplementary Table S1 and S2.
Nasopharyngeal fluid collection with swab and RV detection. For the detection of the RV in the upper airways, a nasopharyngeal specimen from control children and asthmatic children was collected using a pernasal applicator swab, which has a tip with flocked soft nylon fiber (E-Swab 482CE; Copan, Brescia, Italy).
RV detection was performed at the Department of Virology, University of Turku (Finland). Therefore, nucleic acids were extracted using easyMag extractor (BioMeriex, Marcy lEtoile, France) from 200l of the medium according to the manufacturers instruction. An in house PCR method was used to detect enteroviruses, RV s and respiratory syncytial viruses as described earlier. A commercial test kit (Anyplex II RV16 Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses (adenovirus; influenza A and B viruses; parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; RV A, B, and C; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; bocavirus 1,2,3,4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, and OC43; metapneumovirus; and enteroviruses) (see Supplementary Figure S1c).
Culture of human A549 lung epithelial cells and murine lung CD4+ T cells and infection with RV1b. To infect the cells with RV1b, cells were shook for 1h at room temperature with RV1b suspension. RV1b was grown as previously described. Comparable treatment with UV-irradiated RV1b or medium served as a control. After RV infection, the cells were washed with medium. A549 cells were cultured for 24h with medium alone or with an increasing concentration of rhIL-17A as indicated. Lung CD4+ T cells were cultured without additional stimuli for 24h.
Mice. Mixed gender of Il17a (/) mice (generously provided to us by Yoichiro Iwakura) and wild-type mice on a Balb/c genetic background were used at the age of 68 weeks. The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and all experiments were undertaken with approved license (54-2532.1-2/10 from the government of Mittelfranken, Bavaria, Germany).
OVA sensitization and challenge. Mice received intraperitoneal (IP) injections either of phosphate-buffered saline or of 500g/ml ovalbumin (OVA) complexed with 10% alum on days 0 and 7 as described previously. On days 18, 19, and 20 the animals were treated intranasally (IN) with phosphate-buffered saline alone or OVA in phosphate-buffered saline (2mg OVA/ml phosphate-buffered saline in solution).
Gene Array in purified lung CD4+ T cells from wild type and Il17a deficient OVA-sensitized mice. The gene array was performed at the Institute of Human Genetics in Erlangen. Briefly, RNA from lung CD4+ T cells from OVA-sensitized Il17a (/) and wild-type mice was isolated, the quality control was performed and the GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST Array was used for further analysis as previously described.
Silencing of OAS1 in A549 cells infected with RV1b. Lung epithelial cells A549 were transfected with OAS1 siRNA (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMART pool, Lafayette, CO) and afterwards they were cultured and infected with RV1b in the presence of increasing concentrations of rhIL-17A for 24h. For supervisory purpose and to visualize effective transfection we also transfected the cells with a non-targeting (NT) control (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus Control Pool, Non-Targeting pool).
RV PCR and real-time PCR. To verify that the infection with RV1b was successful a PCR was performed as described previously with some modifications. Therefore, cDNA from infected cells and primers, which are complementary to the antisense RNA at positions 542557 and 169185 in the 5-noncoding region of RV1b, called OL26 and OL27, was used. A 380-bp amplicon was generated and the samples were analysed and quantified using the QIAxcel Advanced System (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). For detection of RV1b via real-time PCR, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The resulting template cDNA was amplified by quantitative real-time PCR using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mnchen, Germany) and 200nM primers.
Statistical analysis. Differences were evaluated for significance (*P0.05; **P0.01, ***P0.001) by using one-way ANOVA or the Students t-test for independent events (Excel, Microsoft, version 2003; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington), as indicated in the figure legends. Data are given as mean valuess.e.m.
