Femoral heads were obtained during hip arthroplasty operations following femoral neck fractures. The degrees of osteoarthritis (OA) were evaluated on X-rays using Croft's modification of the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system. Cells from patients with advanced OA (¥grade 3) were not used for the experiments. Within 8 hours after surgery, the cartilage was separated from the bone, reduced to small pieces, and digested with collagenase CLS type II (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) dissolved in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Following a 16-hour digestion period, cells were filtered, washed, and prepared for the experiments. The cells' preparation had been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg as part of the Tissue bank for research in the field of tissue engineering project (GTE-2002).
Synovia obtained during knee operations with an arthrotomy was kept buffered at 4°C. Within 8 hours after surgery, synovia was minced in pieces measuring about 3  3mm followed by transfer into Ham's F-12 medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 1% collagenase P (Roche, Mannheim). The suspension was digested in an incubator for 16h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Liberated synovial fibroblasts (SFB) were filtered, washed, and seeded in expansion media (Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 1  P/S).
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparin-treated human whole blood by a Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) gradient. The layer containing PBMCs was collected and washed three times with PBS. According to manufacturer's instructions, the cell population purified by this method consists of mainly lymphocytes and monocytes with little addition of granulocytes and erythrocytes.
One million chondrocytes (CHDR) were resuspended in 1mL 1.2% alginic acid (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) and transferred into a syringe with a 27G needle (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). In order to polymerize stable CHDR/alginate beads, the cell suspension was dripped into 0.1M CaCl2 solution. After 2 wash steps with PBS, the beads were cultivated for one day in Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 1  P/S, at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Two hundred thousand SFB per well in a 6-well plate were seeded and cultivated in Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 1  P/S, at 37°C, 5% CO2 for one day. The following day, around 20 alginate beads were given to the SFB per well. On the same day, freshly isolated MNC were adjusted to 1  106 cells per mL and placed in cell culture inserts with 1m pore size (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) and cultivated for one day in Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 1  P/S, at 37°C, 5% CO2 in 6-well plates. On the following day, cell culture inserts were placed into the CHDR and SFB coculture. Over the following 3 days, we carried out a preconditioning phase of the coculture. With the start of the experiment on day 0, the coculture was challenged with 250ng/mL LPS (product number L6529, serotype E. coli. 055:B5, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). On day 3, one half of the LPS challenged coculture was superchallenged by adding 100ng/mL PMA (product number P1585, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). On days 0, 3, and 7 half of the media was exchanged to minimize the inflammatory burden. This procedure was adapted to arthroscopic joint rinsing to minimize and halt the inflammatory burden. Media collected on days 0, 3, 7, and 10 were preserved at 80°C.
A consecutive series of 75 patients were recruited for the prospective collection of knee joint lavage fluid. Inclusion criteria consisted of an arthroscopy of the knee joint because of an acute infection (confirmed macroscopically and microbiologically), informed consent to participate in the study, and aged between 1870 years (MISSinG, DRKS 00003536). The 5 patients in the control group had no infection or cartilage lesions in MRI and diagnostic arthroscopy. Effusions were taken during arthroscopy and immediately kept frozen. Specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. For model validation, 7 effusions were selected which fulfilled the conditions of a clearly defined starting point (all postoperative infections following arthroscopy) in basically healthy individuals (ASA 1 or 2). This setup ensured comparable conditions and a matching time frame for in vitro and in vivo analysis. The validation group's average age was 38 years  16 years, with a male/female ratio of 57/43%. The study was approved by the Ethics Board of the University of Freiburg (AN-EK-FRBRG-50/11). All patients participating in this study provided their written consent.
Cytokines and proteins as IL-1, bFGF, IGF-1, ACAN, and BMP-7 detected in synovial joint fluids from acutely infected knee joints and coculture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA (RnD, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, this assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. The microplate was precoated with a specific monoclonal antibody. Supernatants were applied to the wells and, after washing, an HRP-conjugated specific antibody was added to the wells. Following the next wash, color development was proportional to the protein concentration and was calculated by comparison with a standard.
In order to normalize cytokine and mediators secreted in the synovial fluid as well as into the supernatant of the coculture, we divided cytokine and mediator concentrations by the amount of total protein present (TP) in synovial fluids and coculture supernatants using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, standard and working reagents were prepared for microplate procedure as instructed by the manufacturer. Twenty-five microliters of standard and unknowns was pipetted into a 96-well microplate followed by adding 200L to each well. The subsequent incubation at 37°C lasted 30 minutes (°C = degree Celsius). Measurements were taken at 562nm in a TECAN Infinite M200 Reader.
RT-PCR was carried out for CHDR and SFB. RNA samples from days 0, 3, 7, and 10 were transcribed into cDNA; RNA analysis was carried out for gene expression of aggrecan, IL-1, BMP-7, bFGF, and IGF-1. Total mRNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA (1 µg) was treated with 1U DNAse I (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) to remove genomic DNA. Poly-T primed cDNA synthesis was done using 1U reverse transcriptase III (RTIII, Invitrogen) per 1g RNA according to manufacturer's instruction. TaqMan PCR assays were performed in 384-well plates in a Roche LightCycler480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using the Roche LightCycler Mastermix. For gene expression analyses, Roche's universal ProbeLibrary Probes and recommended Universal ProbeLibrary Reference Gene Assays were used. The 2-step cycling conditions were denaturation at 95°C for 5min, followed by 45 amplification cycles at 95°C, 10sec, 60°C, 35sec, and 72°C 1sec. Data was quantified via CT comparisons. Data were normalized by comparing genes of interest versus reference genes (ACTB). Reaction efficiency is controlled by a relative standard curve and/or a calibrator per reaction.
CHDR/alginate beads from days 0, 3, 7, and 10 were preserved by fixation in PBS-buffered 2% formaldehyde for 24h at room temperature, followed by fixation in 50mM BaCl2/1% sucrose and 1% eosin for 30 minutes. Afterwards, CHDR/alginate beads were dehydrated by graded dehydration in isopropyl alcohol (75%, 96%, and 100%) for 10min each, followed by paraffin embedding. To detect sulfated glycoproteins synthesized by CHDR, 5m cuttings of CHDR/alginate beads were rehydrated in xylol and graded isopropyl alcohol (100%, 96%, and 75%) steps for 10min each. After a short rinse in dH2O, incubation in 0.1N HCl for 10min followed by incubation in 1% Alcian/Blue/0.1N HCl for 60min took place. Counterstaining was carried out by nuclear fast red-aluminum sulfate solution 0.1% for 10min followed by dehydration in graded isopropyl alcohol (75%, 96%, and 100%) and xylol for 5min each and embedding in Entellan (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). Image acquisition and analysis were done using Zeiss Axioplan 200 and Axiovision 4.6, respectively.
SFB grown on cover slides in coculture approaches were fixed by PBS-buffered 2% formaldehyde for 24h at room temperature, followed by giemsa staining for 10min. Image acquisition and analysis were done by Zeiss Axioplan 200 and Axiovision 4.6, respectively. Cell numbers were evaluated by ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, NIH, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download). Colored pictures were converted to gray scale pictures. Background correction, scale adjustment, and watershed analysis (discrimination of adjacent cells) were carried out, followed by counting the numbers of particles larger than 50m2. The correlation factor of 44.9 was obtained by dividing the sizes of growth area per well (9.62e4m2) in a 6-well plate by a factor through that of the section's image size (2.14e5m2).
ELISA and TP were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions (RnD, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), creating a standard curve and reducing data using a four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve fit by using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All values were expressed as mean  standard deviation. Data sets were examined with one- and two-way analysis of variance, and individual group means were then compared with the unpaired Student's t-test. In case of unequal variances, we applied the Aspin-Welch test. Since in vitro data did not reveal a normal distribution, statistical significance was nonparametrically tested using the U test according to Mann and Whitney. Statistical significance was defined when P < 0.05.
