This study was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Treatment of Human Subjects of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Permit Number: 20A6-2869), and a written informed consent was also obtained from each participant.
Lung cancer patients (N=30) and healthy adults (N=30) were from the first affiliated hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Lung cancer patients were diagnosed as carcinoma by pathologic diagnosis. Patients who received preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or operation before collecting blood sample had been excluded. The detailed clinical data (including age, gender, smoking history) were obtained from each objects medical records and listed in  Table 3 . Among lung cancer patients, there were 24 cases of adenocarcinoma, 2 cases of squamous carcinoma, 2 cases of alveolar cell carcinoma, and 2 cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Venous blood (10 ml) with EDTA-K2 was collected from healthy controls and lung cancer patients before operation. Plasma was separated and stored at 70°C prior to measuring IFNG. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (GE Health Care Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs using a CD4-positive isolation kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). The purity of isolated CD4+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry using PE-conjugated anti-CD4 (Beckman, Marseille, France). CD4+ T cells were then collected for DNA extraction, bisulfite modification, and sequencing.
The human NSCLC cell line SPC-A1 was purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, and cultured in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), penicillin G (50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 µg/mL).
Transwell experiments were performed in 24 well plates with pore size 0.4 µm (Corning Costar, Corning, NY, USA). SPC-A1 cells (2105) were cultured in the outer wells of 24 well plates in 1640-medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum. CD4+ T cells (6105) separated from healthy adults were added into the inner wells in the same medium. As shown in Fig. 3, control groups were established with CD4+ T cells growing in the inner wells without SPC-A1 cells. After 5 days of culture, CD4+ T cells were washed, and 1106 cells were collected for DNA extraction, while the remaining was transferred to 96-well culture plates. 5104 cells/well were stimulated with 1 µg/ml soluble anti-CD3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and 1 µg/ml soluble anti-CD28 (eBioscience) (in a total volume of 200 µl) for 6 or 24 h. After stimulating, supernatants were collected for IFNG detection by ELISA, CD4+ T cells were collected for IFNG mRNA analysis.
IFNG levels in culture supernatants and plasma were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturers protocol.
PBMCs were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/mL). Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml and incubated 4 h. PBMCs samples were taken from responding cultures and stained with a combination of fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs consisting of anti-CD8-PE-CY5 and anti-CD3-FITC (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA). After fixation and permeabilization (Fix Perm, Caltag, Buckingham, UK), cells were stained with anti-IFNG-PE and isotypic mAbs (BD PharMingen). Isotype-matched control antibodies were used to determine the level of background staining for the mAb mixture. All events were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Data were analyzed with CELL Quest software (BD PharMingen).
RNA isolation was performed using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and reverse transcribed using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturers protocol. cDNA was analyzed for the expression of target genes and quantified by RT-PCR using SYBR Premix Ex Taq¢.Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR primers used were: IFN--forward, 5-GCA GGT CAT TCA GAT GTA GCG G-3; IFN--reverse, 5-TGT CTT CCT TGA TGG TCT CCA CAC-3; DNMT1-forward, 5-GAT CGA ATT CAT GCC GGC GCG TAC CGC CCC AG-3; DNMT1-reverse, 5-ATG GTG GTT TGC CTG GTG C-3; DNMT3b-forward, 5-CCT GCT GAA TTA CTC ACG CCC C-3; DNMT3b-reverse, 5-GTC TGT GTA GTG CAC AGG AAA GCC-3; -actin-forward, 5-TGG CAC CCA GCA CAA TGA A-3; -actin-reverse, 5-CTA AGT CAT AGT CCG CCT AGA AGC A-3. Ct values were normalized to expression in CD4+ T cells using the 2Ct method and -actin as the housekeeping gene. Experiments were done in triplicate, and results from three independent experiments were averaged.
Methylation analysis was conducted using bisulfite sequencing. Genomic DNA of CD4+ T cells was isolated using QIAamp Mini Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA was bisulfite converted using CpGenome¢ DNA modification Kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufactures instructions. The primers used to amplify the IFNG promoter were: IFNG-forward, 5-TGT GAA TGA AGA GTT AAT ATT TTA TTA-3; IFNG-reverse, 5-TTG GTA GTA ATA GTT AAG AGA ATT TA-3. PCR products were generated using the bisulfite-treated DNA as template.
The most prominent PCR band was separated on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified by gel extraction (Qiagen), treated with TA cloning using DNA-Tailing (TaKaRa), and sequenced on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems). All operations were performed by GeneScript Corporation (a sino-America joint venture, Nanjing, China). Sequences were analyzed by bioinformatics software Chromas Version 1.45 (Technelysium, South Brisbane, Australia).
All data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Independent t tests were used to compare plasma IFNG levels and intracellular differences between patients and healthy controls. The data are summarized as meanSD. Methylation differences in the IFNG promoter between different groups were assessed using a Pearson Chi-square test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
