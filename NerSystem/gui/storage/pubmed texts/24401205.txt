BoHV-1 Los Angeles (LA) (American Type Culture Collection, VR-188) and BoHV-1gEgal strains were propagated in Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells grown in Eagles Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Virus DNA was extracted from cell-free supernatant virus preparations following a standard phenol/chloroform procedure using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and proteinase K lysis, phenol/ether extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Discrete flanking regions corresponding to gE gene were amplified by PCR from this material. Primer sequences were based on the published BoHV-1 glycoprotein E (gE) gene sequences [GenBank Accession Number NC 001847]. Primers were designed to add restriction sites in order to facilitate further cloning. The left flanking region of gE (L fragment) was obtained using primers gE1 (5-GCGAGCAGCGGGAGCGGGGCC-3),; and gE2(5-GGGGCGGATCCGTGGGTTGCA-3), which introduced a Sal I and a Bam HI sites, respectively. The right flanking region of gE (R fragment) was amplify using primers gE3(5- AGCTTGGATCCCGGCCGCACC- 3) and gE4 (5- CCTCAGAATTCGGGGTCTCGG- 3), which introduced a Bam Hi and an EcoR I sites to amplified fragment, respectively.
DNA fragments corresponding to the left (L) and right (R) gE flanking regions obtained by PCR were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned sequentially into the pUC19 vector (Clontech). First, the L product (734 bp long, corresponding to position 120956 to 121714 of the BoHV-1 genome) was cloned between the SalI and BamHI sites (recombinant plasmid pUCL), and then the R product (632 bp long, corresponding to position 123375 to 124008 of the BoHV-1 genome) was cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (recombinant plasmid pUCLR), using a BamHI site that linked both L and R fragments. The blunt 4.5 kb fragment, which contains the bacterial -gal gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (HCMV-IE), was inserted into the blunted BamHI site of pUCLR. The resulting gE-deletion/-gal insertion plasmid (pUCLR-gal) carried a deletion of 1,640 bp of BoHV-1 DNA, and the insertion of the -gal gene controlled by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. In pUCLR-gal, the -gal gene is flanked by virus-specific sequences required for recombination with the viral DNA: a 734 bp upstream sequence (L) containing part of the gE promoter and the first 23 bp of the coding sequence, a 632 bp downstream sequence (R) containing the last 67 bp at the 3 extreme, and the complete ORF of the US9 gene (474 bp). Identity of both fragments corresponding to L and R were confirmed by sequencing (Fmol, Promega) (data not shown).
To generate the BoHV-1 gE-deleted recombinant virus, MDBK cells were co-transfected with a ScaI linearized pUCLR-gal plasmid DNA together with a full-length DNA derived from BoHV-1 LA strain. Briefly, a mixture of 2 g of parental BoHV-1 LA DNA, 0.2 g of ScaI linearized pUCLRgal vector and 16 l of Lipofectamine (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies) was added onto a 60% confluent MDBK cell monolayergrown in a 6-well plate, and then incubated for 8 hours at 37°C in a CO2-controlled atmosphere. A media change was then performed using MEM containing 5% FBS and the plates were incubated for 16 hours in the same conditions described above. Each transfected cell monolayer was trypsinized and transferred to a 25 cm2 flask containing 5% FBS MEM and incubated until cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. To determine the dilution of the inoculum for the Bluo-gal screening assay, the co-transfection products were titrated by plaque forming units (PFU) and frozen until the screening assay was performed.
Co-transfection products were examined for their -gal expression by histochemical staining of infected cells. The recombinant viruses able to form blue plaques in the presence of the -galactosidase substrate (halogenated indolyl--D-galactoside) were plaque purified five times under an agar overlay. Recombinant viruses expressing -gal activity were selected by the appearance of blue plaques.
The recombinant virus was further characterized by PCR (gE-specific primers: gE7: 5-CGCCCGTCTTTCTCCCAG-3 and gE8: 5-GCGGGACGAGGAGAGGGA-3) and by Southern blot analysis targeting a part of the gE ORF. Lack of gE protein expression in BoHV-1gEgal infected cell lysates done by Western blot.
Genomic DNA extracted from purified wild-type and recombinant BoHV-1 viruses were digested with HindIII and the corresponding fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.6% agarose TBE gel, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Zprobe, Bio-Rad).. The membrane bearing the immobilized DNA fragments was blocked with 2x SSC solution and fixed by heating at 80°C for 30 minutes. Hybridization was performed separately with three specific probes (L, R, y gE) previously obtained by PCR and labeled with 32S (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System, Promega).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) and additional immunoblot analyses were performed using mock and virus-infected cells. Briefly, either mock (non-infected MDBK cells) and virus-infected cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 12,000 g for 1 h at 47°C, resuspended in sample buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM PMSF, 8 M urea, 1% SDS, 2 mM DTT and 2% -Mercaptoethanol), boiled for 10 minutes, separated by gel electrophoresis in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and blotted on to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight in phosphate buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% skim milk (all subsequent steps were performed using this buffer). Then, they were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with the corresponding monoclonal antibodies: anti-gE, MAb3 (kindly provided by Dr. J.T. Van Oirschot from the Institute of Animal Science and Health, Lelystad, Netherlands), or anti-gD (kindly provided by Dr. L.A. Babiuk from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada). After three washes with PBST, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG rabbit antiserum (KLP Inc) for 1 hour at 37°C. After washing three times, antibody binding was visualized by chemiluminescence (Renaissance kit, NEN Life Science) after exposure to an X-ray film (CurixOrto ST-G2, AGFA).
The growth kinetics of the BoHV-1gEgal strain in MDBK cells was compared to that of the parental BoHV-1 LA strain. A series of replicate cultures of MDBK cells were infected separately with a MOI of 0.1 per cell of recombinant BoHV-1gEgal or the parental BoHV-1 LA strain. Infected cultures were harvested at successive post-infection intervals and frozen in aliquots until titration. Virus titration was performed by the end-point dilution method of Reed & Muench, in three independent repetitions.
BoHV-1 LA or BoHV-1gEgal were propagated according to the conditions described earlier. Preparations were inactivated by treatment with 1% (v/v) 0.1 M binary bromoethylenimine (BEI) for 25 h at 37°C. One volume of inactivated virus suspension was mixed with one volume of INTA mineral oil adjuvant (formulated with Arlacel C, Markol 52 and Tween 80), to produce a water-in mineral oil emulsion according to Smitssart et al..
The animal experiments reported in this manuscript have been performed following internationally recognized guidelines with the approval of the Institutional Committee for Care and Use of Experimental Animals, CICUAE-CICVyA. INTA, Argentina.
Vaccination experiments were performed using 12 to 18 month-old Holando and Angus  Hereford calves with undetectable BoHV-1 serum antibodies (evaluated by ELISA and virus neutralization tests).
All challenge experiments using virulent BoHV-1 LA, and inoculations using attenuated BoHV-1gEgal (dose: 108.25 TCID50/mL) were performed in a type II biosafety animal facility.
Viral challenge was performed using 2 ml virulent BoHV-1 LA (107.5 TCID50/ml) into each nostril, by intranasal inoculation (IN) with an ultrasonic nebulizer (ELECTROLAB AP-300).
Table 1 shows the experimental design describing number of animals, vaccination date and route, date of challenge, date of BoHV-1 specific antibodies determination, BoHV-1 excretion in nasal fluids, date of lymphoproliferative response.
The safety test was performed in pregnant cows. Five pregnant cows (being in the third to sixth month of pregnancy) were IV infected with attenuated BoHV-1gEgal virus (4 ml of the viral suspension with a titer of 108.25 TCID50/ml). Animals were clinically observed until they gave birth and serologically evaluated until 370 dpv. Likewise, newborn calves were also evaluated in regards to their clinical and immune conditions, as well as the virus shedding.
Virus neutralization (VN) was performed using primary fetal bovine testis (FBT) cell cultures in 96-well microtiter plates using the constant virus-variable serum method. Each dilution was tested in four wells containing FBT cell monolayers an adsorbed for 1 hour, the unabsorbed virus was removed and MEM with 5% FBS, was added. Plates were then incubated for 3 days at 37°C and the number of wells and serum dilution showing cytopathic effect was scored. Log10 of the reciprocal value of the highest serum dilution in which CPE was prevented was considered the virus neutralization titer.
Total antibodies against BoHV-1 in bovine serum were measured by an indirect ELISA as described elsewhere. Titers for bovine sera were expressed as Log10 of the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution which gives readings of absorbance greater or equal to 40% of the positive control measuring at an OD of 405 nm. Detection of gE-specific antibodies was performed using a commercial ELISA for BoHV-1 that allows for the detection of gE-specific antibodies (HerdChek Anti-IBR gE/IDEXX Laboratories), according to the manufacturers directions.
The mucosal immune response was determined using a specific ELISA for the detection of IgG1 and IgA. Briefly, nasal swabs were collected and frozen at -80°C. The antigen was prepared as described before (Romera et al.,).
Whole blood samples were collected by venipuncture in syringes containing heparin. Lymphocyte-enriched cells were isolated from the buffy coat as described elsewhere by centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma A.S.). Cells were washed twice in RPMI+5% FBS. UV light-inactivated suspensions of virus-infected MDBK cells (5 g/ml) and control MDBK cells were used as antigens. The corresponding inactivated antigen was added to a 100 l volume of medium containing 2  105 lymphocytes, performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate format. One microgram of the mitogen Concavalin A (Sigma, St Louis, USA) was added to the positive control wells. The lymphocyte cultures were incubated for 4 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Twenty hours before harvesting, 4 Ci of [3H] tymidine was added to each well. Cell proliferation was measured as [3H] tymidine uptake in a scintillation counter (LKB, Wallac, 1219 Rackbeta) and results were obtained as counts per minute (CPM). The values are the mean of the triplicate values and are expressed as stimulation index (SI), where SI=mean CPM of antigen-stimulated lymphocytes/mean CPM of MDBK-stimulated lymphocytes). A threshold value of SI=3 was established.
The capacity of mononuclear cells to secrete interferon  (IFN) in response to a specific in vitro stimulation with inactivated BoHV-1 viral antigen was evaluated by a indirect sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 1.5  106 mononuclear cells were diluted in 100 l of RPMI 10% FBS per well, in sterile microplates of 96 U bottom wells. The supernatant was added on Immulon II microplates, previously sensitized ON with anti bovine IFN monoclonal antibody (mAbs), and blocked with PBST 0.1% BSA. A reference curve was performed using IFN standard at known concentrations. Detection of the captured IFN was done using a rabbit anti-bovine IFN serum, diluted in 0.1% PBST-BSA. In order to improve the sensibility of the assay, plates were later incubated with biotin-labeled rat anti-rabbit IgG and developed using disodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PPN) as substrate. Optical densities (OD) at A405 were measured 25 minutes after the addition of the substrate.
Comparison of the vaccine profiles obtained throughout the experimental period was performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures with the Greenhouse and Geisser correction of the significance levels (fixed at 5%). The post-ANOVA comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni test with the same level of significance. All the statistical calculations were performed using the SAS program (release 6.04), following the G.M.L. procedure.
