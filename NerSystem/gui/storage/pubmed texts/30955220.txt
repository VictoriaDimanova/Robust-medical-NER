In brief, 10% vegetable oleic acid (81%; KLK OLEO, Emmerich, Germany) and 10% cellfree extract containing regio and enantioselective oleate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.53; DSM Chemical Technology, Geleen, The Netherlands) were added to phosphate buffer (1.6 L, 100 mM, pH = 6.5) in a bioreactor and stirred at constant pH and 37°C until ¥95% conversion was reached (approx. 24 h). Ethyl acetate was added to the mixture and heated to 60°C while gently stirring followed by crystallization. Filtration and drying of the obtained, white solid material resulted in the enantiopure (R)10hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (HSA) in 81% yield and 99.8% purity (% w/w, GCFID, HP5MS MS; Agilent, Basel, Switzerland). The enantiomeric excess was found to be >99% determined by chiral HPLC analysis (Chiracel ODH; Daicel, Illkirch, France) after derivatization as methyl ester. The melting point of the resulting white powder was 86.5°C. Commercial material (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) is available with the INCI name HSA.
To determine the effect of HSA on age spot and conspicuous pore reduction we examined extracellular matrix marker production (Collagen type I and III) together with degradative enzymes (MMP1), reduction of markers of UV damage [sunburn cells (SBC) and p53], the secretome of fibroblast markers that may influence both keratinocytes and melanocytes and clinically. Moreover, the likely mechanistic target of action was identified as PPAR from in silico and transactivation assays.
Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) obtained from adult skin were seeded into 96well plates (4000 cells per well) and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium high glucose (DMEM, Gibco Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Amimed BioConcept, Allschwil, Switzerland) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S; Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Subsequently the cells were starved in DMEM low glucose containing 0.2% FCS and 1% P/S for 2.5 days. Starvation medium was then refreshed together with the addition of the solubilized test compounds and incubated for another 48 h. Thereafter, HSA was diluted in the culture medium from a 10 mM dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) stock solution. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF1; PeproTech, Hamburg, Germany) was used as positive control. After compound incubation, cells were fixed in Dulbecco's PhosphateBuffered Saline (DPBS; Gibco Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) containing 4% formaldehyde (Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX100 (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) in DPBS for 90 s. Collagen type I or III was detected using mouse antihuman collagen I antibody (Millipore, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) and rabbit antihuman type III collagen (BioTrend, Cologne, Germany), respectively, followed by an AlexaFluor 488conjugated secondary antibody (goat antimouse or antirabbit IgG, Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland). We counterstained the nuclei with 4,6diamidino2phenylindole (SigmaAldrich). Image acquisition and quantitative analysis was performed using an ArrayScan VTI HCS imaging system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 49 pictures per well with 10 objective. Collagen was measured intracellularly, and the fluorescence intensity values were normalized to the cell count. Data are based on a minimum of three independent measurements and were represented as mean values  standard error of mean (SEM); Studentt test, significance P < 0.01 vs. medium control.
Human skin from abdominal plastic surgery was obtained from healthy Caucasian donors after their informed consent and was used for the analysis of collagen type III, SBCs, MMP1 and p53. Skin samples of 8  3 mm (diameter  thickness) were maintained in an airliquid interface in contact with culture medium (modified Williams E medium; Thermo Fisher Scientific) up to 6 days. Six skin samples for each treatment were cultured to perform the collagen, SBC and p53 analyses and two samples for the skin viability and MMP1 expression. For MMP1, SBCs and p53 analysis the test samples (4 L, 0.33 and 3.30 mM) were topically applied in DMSO as vehicle on the skin biopsies (8 mm diameter) 1 and 24 h prior to UVB irradiation (1 J cm2) and covered with 7 mm diameter delivery membrane (CoTran, 3M, Italy). The sensorcontrolled BIOSUN irradiation system (Vilber Lourmat, Eberhardzell, Germany) equipped with two T30.M tubes (30 W, intensity 3 mW cm2) was used to irradiate the skin with UVB light. The UV emission spectrum ranged from 280 to 400 nm, of which 62% emission was in the UVB range (280320 nm, peak maximum 312 nm) and elongated in the UVA range (320400 nm).
After 6 days of incubation, two skin punches were weighted and, if necessary, reduced in the dermal portion, to have approximately the same weight for all samples. Samples were processed with methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) according to supplier's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Skin viability was measured with a plate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.
Two sections (n = 12) from six skin samples were immunostained with monoclonal mouse anticollagen III (SigmaAldrich, cat#c7805) and the Alkaline Phosphatase/RED Detection System (Dako #K5005; Agilent Technologies, Glostrup, Denmark). The amount of the antigen present in each slide was evaluated by the intensity and the distribution of the red staining within a selected area of the dermis using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Total RNA was extracted from fullthickness skin using RNAeasy mini kit for fibrous tissues (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. After quantification, 400 ng of total RNA was retrotranscribed using random hexamers and Superscript III (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The cDNA was used to perform a realtime PCR (SybrGreen protocol) with specific primers for the evaluation of MMP1 expression. Ubiquitin and YWHAZ (Tyrosine 3Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5Monooxygenase Activation Protein Zeta) were used as reference genes for data normalization. Data acquisition and statistical analysis of RTqPCR were performed on RotorGene thermal cycler (Corbett Life Science, Mortlake, Vic, Australia) and REST 2009 V2.0.13 software (Qiagen, Darmstadt, Germany).
HaematoxylinEosin (H&E) staining was performed on skin sections to count SBC or apoptotic cells per millimeter of epidermis after analysing twelve different sections per treatment.
Skin sections were stained with the monoclonal mouse antip53 antibody (#ab7757; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The p53positive cells were counted, and the obtained values were divided upon the area covered by epidermis. Two slides of each skin sample were processed by image acquisition and related analysis (i.e. 12 images for each test treatment).
All quantitative data were summarized in terms of the mean score and SEM for each treatment. Differences between groups were evaluated by oneway ANOVA with permutation test followed by pairwise posthoc comparisons Dunnett's permutation test and pairwise posthoc comparisonsTukey's HSD permutation tests.
Human dermal fibroblasts from a biopsy of an adult female donor were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS and 1% P/S. Cells were cultivated at 37°C, 5% CO2air atmosphere. HDF were seeded in 6well plates (120 000 cells per well) and cultured for 24 h in DMEM 10% FCS 1% P/S, then starved in DMEM low glucose, 0.2% FCS and 1% P/S for 2.5 days. Starvation medium was then replaced, 5 M HSA was added and incubated for 48 h. The preparation of the extracellular secreted proteins from the conditioned media was performed, using 20 mM ammonium hydroxide and stringent washing with water 20. Secreted protein isolates obtained from the cell culture conditioned media were dissolved in 600 L of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 0.5 g of trypsin culture plate wells. Plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C. Total protein content was determined using the BCA kit from Thermo Scientific (Illkirch, France). Lysates from same sample were pooled and acidified to block trypsin activity. Lysates were evaporated to dryness (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific). Proteins were then reduced (DTT) and alkylated (IAA) and trypsin added a second time to complete protein digestion. For all samples, peptides were purified by SPE chromatography (C18), dried and solubilized in 100 L of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution. Peptide digests (500 ng per run) were analysed by Eksigent Ultra Plus nanoLC 2D HPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 5600 (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) mass spectrometer interfaced to a nanospray III source, according to the method described in Voegeli et al. 21. The absolute signal of peptide or protein was calculated by summing the extracted area of all unique fragment ions as described in Gillet et al. 22.
A onehybridsystem, using hybrid constructs of GAL4 DNAbinding part coupled to PPAR, PPAR or PPAR ligand binding domains together with a luciferase reporter and a renillaexpressing plasmid, was applied. For transient transfections, white 96well cell culture plates with clear bottom (Corning, Basel, Switzerland) were used. As many as 7.5  104 HEK293 cells per well were plated in minimum essential medium (Eagle) at 37°C in 5% CO2 without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoaltreated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The cells were transiently transfected at 7080% confluence by polyethyleneminebased transfection for 5 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, which was followed with respective stimulations of the applied compounds dissolved in DMSO (0.45% final DMSO concentration in the wells). The GW7647 compound was used as a reference for human PPAR. Stimulations lasted 16 h according to established protocols. Transfection efficiency was adjusted to renilla expression (Promega AG, Dbendorf, Switzerland). All concentrations were tested in three biological replicates. The dose response for one site was applied in a curvefitting model according to the formula: y = A + ((B  A)/(1 + ((10C)/x)D)), where A is the minimum yvalue, B the maximum yvalue, C Log EC50 and D the slope factor. The data were fitted by XLfit (http://www.idbs.com) using the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm.
The ligand binding domain of PPAR alpha was retrieved from the RSCB database (PDB: 3SP6) and prepared for modelling studies using a protein preparation wizard (Maestro version 11.0.015; Schrdinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2016). In short, bond orders were set, hydrogens were added, disulphide bridge was created, all water molecules were removed and hydrogen bonds were optimized using the automated procedure. HSA was docked to the ligand binding domain (Glide, LLC, New York, NY, 2016) and the Standard Precision (SP) setting was used. For docking, multiple conformers of HSA were generated (Confgen, LLC, New York, NY, 2016). Among the topranked different binding poses generated, the best pose was selected based on visual inspection. Figures were prepared using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8.0.4 Schrdinger, LLC.
The study was authorized by the new substance release committee (DSM Nutritional Products, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. Written informed consent was collected from all volunteers before enrollment. Before the start of the study, healthy volunteers were advised not to use any cosmetic treatments for 3 days. Two panels with 42 Caucasian females with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IIIII were recruited to apply 1% (33 mM) HSA in a cosmetic product formulation (Table 1) or the vehicle formulation, respectively, on the face twice daily for 8 weeks. Thirtyseven completed the study and were included in the final analysis from the product group (aged 3865, mean 53.4  7.6 years) and 38 in the placebo group (aged 3465, mean 54.4  7.2 years). No other topical leaveon product was authorized on face during the study and only a specified cleansing milk was allowed (INCI list: AQUA, PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, ALCOHOL DENAT., GLYCERYL STEARATE SE, POLYSORBATE 60, SORBITAN STEARATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CARBOMER).
Table 1 describes the product formulation and corresponding vehicle without HSA that was used in the clinical study.
Subjects were acclimatized for 30 min at a temperature of 24  2°C and 35  10% relative humidity before any images were taken. Fullface cross and parallelpolarized VISIACR images (Canfield Scientific, Parsippany, NJ, USA) were assessed at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks during January 19 to March 15, 2016 in Northern Germany. Image analysis and statistics on conspicuous facial pores and solar lentigines were performed with calibrated VISIA images (Newtone, Lyon, France). Three pigmented spots were selected on the chosen profile of each subject from the crosspolarized images with the largest area and the best contrast. The contrast was calculated from the difference of the ITA° values (individual topological angle based on CIE L  a  b values) of the surrounding skin minus the age spot. For the conspicuous pores analysis, the parallelpolarized images were used to see distinctly the pores and defined areas near the nose on each image for each subject. After segmentation, the identified pores could be analysed in terms of area, depth and volume.
For age spots the ITA° were expressed as mean values  SEM and significance level P < 0.05 product vs. vehicle was determined by Student ttest. For pores the surface and volume differences of conspicuous pores for product and vehicle treatment were compared to T = 0 and expressed in mean  SEM by ShapiroWilk test followed by a MannWhitney test using significance level of P < 0.05 product vs. vehicle.
