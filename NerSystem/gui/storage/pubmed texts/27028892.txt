Our study included data that was obtained from 128 patients with histologically confirmed colon cancer who underwent surgery at the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from January 2004 to December 2011 (Jinan, Shandong, China),This including one group of 38 patients in which we compared para-tumor with tumor tissue and another group of 90 patients were included in the survival analysis. The collection and use of tissue samples complied with the relevant guidelines and institutional practices of the Ethics Committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, and written approval was obtained in each case before tissue sample collection. The ethics committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University approved this study (KYLL-2013-069). The key clinicopathological data are shown in Table 1 and the Supplementary Materials and methods (S1 File).
Sections (4 m) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colon tumor tissue samples were dewaxed, rehydrated, and incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-human galectin-9 (sc-366141, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and mouse monoclonal anti-human CD56 (3576, 1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,USA). The sections were subsequently stained with the corresponding secondary antibodies. Two independent pathologists who were blinded to the clinical data, evaluated the immunohistochemical results. The method used to evaluate the tissues is described in the Supplementary Materials and methods (S1 File).
Cells were incubated according to the standard procedures described in the ATCC culture guide. The human colon tumor cell lines SW480, SW620 and HT29 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FCS) (Bio International, USA). The human NK92 cell line was a gift from The Second Military Medical University (Shanghai, China) and cultivated with Alpha Minimum Essential medium (Gibco, USA) containing 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate but without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, and various components were added to obtain complete growth medium: 0.2 mM inositol (17508, Sigma, USA); 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (ES-007E, Merck Millipore, Germany); 0.02 mM folic acid (F8758, Sigma, USA); 100200 U/mL recombinant IL-2; and adjustment to a final concentration of 12.5% horse serum (16050, Gibco, USA) and 12.5% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated at 5% CO2 according to the standard procedures in the ATCC culture guide.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained after centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). NK cells were isolated using NK Cell Isolation Kits (MiltenyiBiotec, Germany) according the manufacturers instructions. The purity of CD3-CD56+ cells was consistently over 95%, measured through flow cytometric analysis.
We transiently transfected of siRNA against human galectin-9 (siRNA #378 and siRNA #690, GenePharma, Shanghai, China) or scramble siRNA into HT-29 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. The knockdown efficacy of the siRNAs targeting galectin-9 was examined using RT-PCR, western blot analysis and ELISA at 36 h post-transfection. The following siRNA sequences targeting human galectin-9 were used:
siRNA378: sense, 5-GGAAGACACACAUGCCUUUTT-3; antisense, 5-AAAGGCAUGUGUGUCUUCCTT-3; and siRNA 690: sense, 5-CCAUUACCCAGACAGUCAUTT-3; antisense, 5-AUGACUGUCUGGGUAAUGGTT-3.
We used transwell chambers with a 5-mm pore membrane (Costar, Corning, NY, USA). NK-92 cells or primary NK cells were plated in the top chambers. Colon tumor cell culture supernatant or varying concentrations of rh-galectin-9 (2045-GA-050, R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were added to the bottom chamber. NK-92 cells or primary NK cells were permitted to migrate into the bottom chamber for 4 h at 37°C, They were then harvested and counted using cell-count boards. Because NK cells have a relatively high rate of spontaneous migration, we used the following the migration index (MI) to evaluate the results: migration index = the number of cells migrated/the number of randomly migrating cells (no chemokine). Y-27632 dihydrochloride (20 M) (ab120129, Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts,UK) and C3 transferase (2.0 g/mL) (CT04-A, Cytoskeleton, Denvor, CO, USA) were added to test the role of Rho/ROCK signaling in NK migration. IL-12 (7.5 ng/mL) was used as a positive control for NK cell chemoattraction (200-12P80, Peprotech, Chicago, USA).
Cell lysates were resuspended in a small volume of lysis buffer as previously described and then subjected to western blot analysis. The details of the western blotprocedure are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods (S1 File).
Total RNA was extracted from cultured/transfected cells using TRIzol reagent (15596026, Invitrogen, USA) and then stored at -20°C. Using aReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (FSQ-101, Toyobo, Japan), we reverse transcribed 1 g of total RNA into DNA in a one-step reaction.This was followed by PCR to amplify the transcripts of the corresponding target molecule. The RT reactions and PCR steps were performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Table 2 lists the primer sequences that were obtained from Primer Bank. The target gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH levels that were run during the same reaction.
The supernatants of HT29 tumor cells were collected at 36h post-transfection. Each supernatant was centrifuged and stored at -80°C.Ahuman galectin-9 ELISA kit(Cusabio, WuHan, HuBei Province, China) was used according to the manufacturers instructions to measure galectin-9 production in each supernatant.
NK-92 cells treated with or without rh-galectin-9 for 4 h were added to anti-off slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 (X100, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (PHDR1, Cytoskeleton, USA) and DAPI (C1002, Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturers instructions. Image capturing and processing were performed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM710, ZEISS, Germany).
Survival was measured as the number of months from resection to the last review. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival curves, and the log rank test was used for the statistical analyses. The statistical analyses were conducted using Pearsons Ï2 tests, Fishers exact tests, t tests and Spearman's rank correlation. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the prognostic value of clinicopathological factors. All tests were two-sided, and P0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
