All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, Georgia, USA. Male Wistar rats (n=24) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (USA) and maintained in the Universitys animal care facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Rats were maintained on standard rat chow (n=12) or HFD (60% fat, 58Y1, TestDiet, PMI Nutrition International, n=12) for 12 weeks as described previously.
Protocols involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, Georgia. Consecutive patients (n=74) who underwent cardiac surgery were enrolled in this study.
With the use of microsurgical instruments and an operating microscope, coronary arterioles (~1 mm in length) from the second branch of the septal artery (~1.5 mm in length) of the rat or from each patients right atrial appendage were isolated and transferred to organ chambers containing 2 glass micropipettes filled with physiological salt solution (PSS) comprising (in mmol/L): 110.0 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.0 KH2PO4, 5.5 glucose, and 24.0 NaHCO3, equilibrated with a gas mixture of 21% O25% CO2-balanced nitrogen, at pH 7.4. The vessels were cannulated at both ends, and the micropipettes were connected with silicone tubing to a pressure servo control system (Living Systems Instrumentation, USA) to set the intraluminal pressure to 80 mmHg. Temperature was set at 37Â°C by a circulating bath temperature controller (Cole Parmer, USA). Changes in arteriolar diameter were continuously recorded with a microangiometer (Colorado Video, USA), connected to a microscope (Olympus BX2, Olympus, USA).
Cumulative concentrations of BK (0.1100 nmol/L), and AngII (1100 nmol/L) were administered to the isolated (rodent or human) coronary arterioles, and changes in diameter were continuously measured. BK-induced responses were also obtained after in vitro incubation with captopril (10 mol/L for 30 min) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 200 mol/L for 30 min). AngII-induced responses were reassessed after in vitro incubation with either AngII receptor 1 (AT1R) antagonist, losartan (10 mol/L for 30 min), and after co-incubation with losartan and the AT2R antagonist, PD 123,319 (10 mol/L for 30min).
Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously. Briefly, heart samples from control (n=4) and HFD obese rats (n=4), as well as from non-obese (n=3) and obese (n=3) patients were embedded and frozen in OCT compound (Tissue Tek, Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). Consecutive sections (8-m thick) of rat hearts were immune-labeled with anti-ACE mouse primary antibody (1:1,000, ab77990, Abcam Inc, USA), anti--smooth muscle actin rabbit primary antibody (1:400, ab5694, Abcam Inc), as well as rabbit polyclonal anti-BK B1 receptor (BK1R, 1:50, sc-25484, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and mouse monoclonal anti-BK B2 receptor (BK2R, 1:50, 610451, BD Transduction Laboratories, USA). Moreover, consecutive sections (8-m thick) of human heart samples were immune-labeled with anti-ACE mouse primary monoclonal antibody (1:400, ab77990, Abcam Inc). Primary antibodies were visualized using Cy3-labeled anti-mouse (1:400, A10520, Invitrogen, USA) and Cy5-labeled anti-rabbit (1:250, A10524, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies correspondingly. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. For nonspecific binding, the primary antibody was omitted. Images were acquired by using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope equipped with an Apotome (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, USA).
Isolated coronary arterioles were incubated with AngI (100 nmol/L, for 15 min) in the absence or presence of the ACE inhibitor, captopril (10 mol/L), and diameter changes were measured. Tissue ACE activity was then expressed as the captopril-inhibited percent change in diameter in response to AngI.
Logistic regression was used to predict patient characteristics potentially associated with coronary arteriolar dilation to BK. Dilation >40% to BK (10 nmol/L) was considered an endpoint for this analysis. Patient characteristics considered significant (P<0.10) in the chi-square univariate analysis were included in multivariate models. PASW Statistics version 18 was used for this analysis. All other statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software (USA) by 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukeys post hoc test or Students t-test as appropriate. Data are expressed as mean  SEM. Agonist-induced arteriolar response was expressed as the change in arteriolar diameter as a percentage of the maximal dilation defined as the passive diameter of the vessel at 80-mmHg intraluminal pressure in a Ca2+-free medium. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
