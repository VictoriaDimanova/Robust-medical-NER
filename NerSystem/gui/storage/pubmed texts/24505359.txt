Cell proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit 8 reagent (CCK-8, DOJINDO, Kyushu, Japan) or CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) into DNA during DNA replication can be used to measure cells undergoing DNA replication. The percentage of cells incorporating EdU was evaluated using the Cell-Light EdU imaging detecting kit following the manufacturers instructions (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China).
Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and fixed overnight in 70% ice-cold ethanol. After fixation, the cells were treated with 500 ng/µl of RNase A for 30 min and subsequently stained with 50 ng/µl of propidium iodide (PI) for 20 min. The cells were quantified using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS, BD, NJ, USA), and the data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR, USA).
Cell apoptosis analysis was performed with the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol, and the cells were analyzed using FACS (BD, NJ, USA).
Total RNA was extracted from the cell lines and tissue samples using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Synthesis of cDNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, WI, USA) was performed as suggested by the manufacturer, and random primers (Takara, Shiga, Japan) were used for mRNA. The qRT-PCR assays were performed using the SYBR Green RealMasterMix kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturers instructions. Reverse Transcription and qRT-PCR for miRNA were performed using the Bulge-Loop miRNA qRT-PCR Primer Set (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China). Data analysis was performed using the 2Ct method. The following primers were used for the analysis: cyclin D1 forward primer, 5-CAA ATG GAG CTG CTC CTG GTG-3, reverse primer, 5-CTT CGA TCT GCT CCT GGC AGG-3; CDK4 forward primer, 5-TGC CAA TTG CAT CGT TCA CCG AG-3, reverse primer, 5-TGC CCA ACT GGT CGG CTT CA-3; actin forward primer, 5-CTC CAT CCT GGC CTC GCT GT-3, reverse primer, 5-GCT GTC ACC TTC ACC GTT CC-3; and 5S rRNA forward primer, 5-ACG GCC ATA CCA CCC TGA AC-3, reverse primer, 5-GGC GGT CTC CCA TCC AAG TA-3.
The 3UTRs of cyclin D1 and CDK4 genes were cloned into the pmirGlo plasmid (Promega, WI, USA) between the XhoI and XbaI sites using the following primers: cyclin D1 wild-type 3UTR forward primer, 5-ATA TCT CGA GCA GGT GCT CCC CTG ACA GTC CCT-3, reverse primer, 5-TAA TCT AGA TGG AAA CAT GCC GGT TAC ATG TTG GT-3; CDK4 wild-type 3UTR forward primer, 5-ATA TCT CGA GGC AAT GGA GTG GCT GCC ATG GAA-3, reverse primer, 5-TAA TCT AGA TTG ACA CAG AGT CTT GCT CTG TTG CCC A-3.
The pmirGlo plasmids containing mutated cyclin D1 or CDK4 3UTR were constructed using the KOD-plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The open reading frame expression vectors pReceiver_M02_cyclin D1, pReceiver_M02_CDK4, and the control vector pReceiver_M02 were purchased from the FulenGen Corporation (GeneCopoeia, MD, USA). All inserted or mutated sequences were confirmed by sequencing.
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. The miRNA mimics (50 nM) and plasmid (5 ng/µL) were co-transfected into A549 cells. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega, WI, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
Cells were harvested and resuspended in SDS buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for preparation of total protein extracts. Briefly, total protein extract was separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto an Immobilon-P transfer polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, MA, USA). The membrane was incubated at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) prepared with TBS-T buffer for 2 h. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody diluted 11,000 with 1% BSA at 4°C overnight. On the following day, the membrane was incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody diluted 15,000 with 1% BSA at 4°C for 6 h. The membrane was visualized after incubation in HRP substrate (BeyoECL plus A/B, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The antibodies used in this study were anti-cyclin D1 (sc-8396, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-CDK4 (sc-260, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti--actin (A2066, Sigma, MO, USA), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (sc-2005, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2004, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
At 6 h after transfection of miR-545 mimics or control miRNA, A549 cells were harvested and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1106 cells/mL and injected into either side of the posterior flank of the same BALB/c athymic nude mice (56 weeks of age) with 100 µL cell suspension. Tumor growth was measured every 4 days. Tumor volume (V) was monitored by measuring the length (L) and width (W) of the tumor with calipers and was calculated using the formula V=(LW2)/2.
The data are presented as the mean  standard deviation (S.D.). P<0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software (Chicago, IL). Students t test was used to analyze the significance between two groups. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significance among more than two groups. The analysis of miRNAs expression in clinical sample was performed using Wilcoxon test.
