Patients were recruited in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medicine 1, FAU Erlangen-Nrnberg, between 2017 and 2018. Biopsy samples were obtained from overall seven healthy controls (5 females, 2 males, mean age 5574 years) who underwent gastroscopy for preventive medical checkup, three patients with active CD (3 females, age 18, 19, and 55 years), and five celiac patients under remission (4 females, 1 male, mean age 2139 years). The study was approved by ethics committee of FAU (Ethikkommission der Friedrich-Alexander-Universitt Erlangen-Nrnberg, ethikkommission@fau.de, AZ 60_17B). All research was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03256266.
Two to three duodenal biopsies per individual were taken with standard endoscopic forceps during routine gastroduodenoscopy and placed in ice-cold 5ml cell basal medium (DMEM/F12, 15mM HEPES (Gibco, Germany), 2mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Germany), 100u/ml penicillin, and 0,1mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Germany) immediately. Crypt units were isolated according the protocol of VanDussen et al. with minor variations. The biopsy samples were washed twice with 5ml cold basal medium (BM) before they were minced with a scalpel and enzymatically digested in 1ml BM with collagenase (2mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich C9407) at 37°C. The digest was pipetted every 5minutes and microscopically controlled. When the tissue structure was mostly dispersed, usually after 2025minutes, the digest was filtered through a 100µm strainer (Falcon, Germany) and strainer rinsed with additional 10ml of BM. Crypt units were collected by low-threshold centrifugation (150200  g) for 5minutes to separate from single cells and cell debris. In case of high impurity with cell debris the crypt cells were resuspended once more in 10ml BM and pelleted at 150200g for 3min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1ml BM, transferred to 2ml vials and sedimented at 2000g for 5min. The supernatant was discarded and crypts were carefully resuspended in 120µl of ice-cold Matrigel matrix (Corning 35623) to enable three dimensional growths. Aliquots   30µl were settled in 24 well plates and plates were incubated in cell culture incubator at 37°C, 5% carbondioxid for 10minutes to allow the Matrigel to solidify. Afterwards, 250µl cell culture medium enriched with supplements (CM-S) was added to each well and replaced every second day.
Organoids were used for assays or cryo conserved at 150°C. Therefore, organoids were washed with ice cold BM to remove Matrigel and collected by centrifugation at 2000g for 5min. Organoid pellets were suspended in 1ml BM, 10% fecal calf serum (FCS, Biochrom, Germany), 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, slowly frozen to 80°C in cryo freezing container (Nalgene, Germany), and transferred to 150°C for long-term storage. For further research the cryo conserved organoids were quickly thawed at 37°C, transferred to10 ml BM, centrifuged at 2000g for 5min, plated with Matrigel and cultured in CM-S medium.
Mouse L-cells that express Wnt3a, R-spondin, and noggin, were commercially purchased (ATCC CRL-3276, Bio Tech Standards, Germany) and conditioned medium (L-WRN) was prepared according instructions and protocol of company and Miyoshi et al.. Culture medium with supplements (CM-S) was prepared using 50% BM and 50% conditioned L-WRN medium, and further supplemented with 15% FCS, 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma, Germany), 1x N-2 supplements (Gibco, Germany), 1  B-27supplements (Gibco, Germany), 50ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10mM nicotinamide (Sigma, Germany), 10nM Leu15-gastrin I (Sigma, Germany), 500 nM A-8301 (inhibitor for ALK4/5/7; Sigma, Germany), 10µM SB202190 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor; Sigma, Germany), and 10µM Y-27632 (p160 ROCK inhibitor; Tocris, Germany) in accordance with the protocols of Sato et al., VanDussen et al., and Miyoshi et al.. Organoids were cultured with 300µl culture medium and medium changed every second or third day.
After five to seven days, when organoids have formed big-circled structures, they were isolated from Matrigel matrix and splitted. Therefore, organoids were washed once with ice-cold Dulbeccos phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, Germany) and sheared by pipetting several times in 500µl ice-cold PBS. Crushed organoids were transferred into 12ml vials (Falcon, Germany), diluted with 10ml PBS, pelleted by centrifugation at 150200g and plated with Matrigel matrix as described above into 68 wells.
For intestinal differentiation the culture medium was replaced by 300µl of 90% BM and 10% L-WRN, 15% FCS, 10µM Y-27632, and 5µM -secretase inhibitor DAPT (Sigma, Germany) as described by VanDussen et al. and organoids were further cultivated for 2 days at 37°C, 5% C02.
Organoids were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 500µl ice-cold cell recovery solutions (Corning, Germany) at 4°C for 30min. Organoids were sheared by several up and down pipetting, transferred into 12ml vial (Falcon, Germany), diluted with 10ml PBS and centrifuged at 200  g. RNA isolation was performed with peqGOLD MicroSpin Total RNA Kit (VWR, Germany) according to manufacturers protocol.
In order to isolate RNA from intestinal tissue, the shock-frozen duodenal biopsies were homogenized with steel balls and the RNA was further isolated with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). RNA concentration and purity were determined with Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Germany).
The isolated RNAs from organoids of five healthy individuals, two patients with active CD, and five patients in remission were pooled, respectively. For RNA gene expression analysis, the XT_PGX_HuV2_Myeloid CodeSet (NanoString nCounter Human Myeloid Innate Immunity V2 Panel, NanoString technology, Seattle, USA; Supplemental Table 1) was applied according to manufacturers protocol. The assay allows the detection of 729 human transcripts and 39 housekeeping genes. In brief, 5µl of the pooled RNA samples (corresponding to 85100ng) were cautiously mixed with 3µl reporter CodeSet, 5µl of hybridization buffer, and 2µl capture ProbeSet, and hybridization was done at 65°C for 22h. The purification and counting of gene expression levels were performed fully automated with NanoString nCounterPrepStation and Digital Analyzer. Gene expression analysis was done with nSolver Analysis Software 4.0.
cDNAs were prepared with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Germany) and real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed with QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen, Germany) for gene expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), collagen type I 2-chain (COL1A2), collagen type XII 1-chain (COL12A1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), serpine peptidase inhibitor member 1 (SERPINE1), and mucin 2 (MUC2). Analysis was done with Bio-Rad CFX-Manager and fold changes calculated with Ct method.
The RNAs of organoids of seven healthy individuals, three patients with active CD, and five patients in remission were pooled, respectively. From each group circa 400ng of combined RNA was used to prepare the corresponding cDNA with the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and further processed with the human epithelial to mesenchymal transition PCR array (Qiagen, Germany) according manufacturers protocol on a 96-well plate with CFX Connect Real time system (Bio-Rad, Germany). Data analysis was performed using the webportal of Qiagen and fold changes of genes were calculated with the Ct method with normalization to housekeeping genes. In addition, the RT2 profiler PCR array for human epigenetic chromatin remodeling (Qiagen, Germany) was done with pooled RNA from the healthy individuals and celiac patients in remission.
