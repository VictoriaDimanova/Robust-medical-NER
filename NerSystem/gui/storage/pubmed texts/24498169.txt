This study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved (Protocol and approval number 2124MSGC/2011) by the institutional review board and the bioethical committee of our institution (Comite de Bioetica del Hospital Abel Zubizarreta, GCBA). Furthermore, written consent was obtained from all the patients.
We collected clinical data and blood samples from 88 ICP patients and 173 unrelated healthy pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy in a cross-sectional, case-control hospital-based study; during the same study period, for each ICP patient in the liver unit, two healthy pregnant women were matched and included in the analysis. The genetic background of both patients and controls was the same, and the control population was matched on ethnicity, area of residence, and time of recruitment with affected individuals.
Diagnosis of ICP was based on the following criteria: 1. presence of pruritus occurring during the second half of an otherwise uneventful pregnancy; 2. the presence of abnormalities in liver function test suggestive of ICP: serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40 and >35 IU/L, respectively; 3. elevated levels of fasting total bile acid (BA) >12 µmol/L; 4. no skin lesions caused by systemic diseases that could cause pruritus; and 5. spontaneous resolution of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings after delivery. All the patients were referred during pregnancy.
Additional inclusion criteria were the absence of infection by hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, and HCV; AxSYM, Abbott Park, IL, USA), autoimmune diseases, moderate-to-severe alcohol intake, HIV infection (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay; Organon Teknika), biliary obstruction, and the use of drugs or alternative medicine therapy known to precipitate cholestasis.
Maternity data including age, geographical origin, pregestational BMI, education, smoking (number of cigarettes/day), history of abortion, history of preterm birth and previous abnormal fetal weight, preeclampsia-eclampsia, hypertension in pregnancy, hyperlipidemia or diabetes, pregnancy weight gain, and weight of the previous offspring were evaluated. Besides, family history of the disease was also recorded.
Resting systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (SABP and DABP, respectively) was measured in all the mothers after they had been sitting for at least 30 min. A mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure three times at the right arm.
Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) was used to evaluate the insulin resistance index and was calculated as follows: Fasting serum insulin (µU/ml)Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5.
None of the mothers had either preeclampsia-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, and none of them were taking any medication.
UDCA was prescribed at doses of 900 mg/day for all the patients with gestational age of <37 weeks until delivery; serum samples were taken at basal conditions at the time of diagnoses.
Complete medical, obstetrical, and perinatal data were recorded. Apgar score and gestational age, assessed using the Capurro method, were registered in all newborns. In addition, all relevant clinical variables, such as gender, cephalic perimeter, birth weight of the newborn, mode of delivery, and perinatal morbidity, were registered for each pregnancy. Signs of fetal distress, such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid or clinical or Doppler ultrasonographic signs of hypoxemia, low birth weight, spontaneous preterm delivery, Apgar score <7, small-for-gestational age, asphyxial events, operative delivery due to asphyxia, or Apgar score <7 at 5 min, were assessed as fetal complications. Small-for-gestational age was defined as the birth weight for gestational age less than the specific 10th percentile cutoff of a published Argentinian fetal growth reference.
In every case, serum samples were extracted after a fasting period of 8 h, and aliquots were frozen at 20oC until chromatographic studies were performed. ALT (normal value <31 IU/L), AST (normal value <46 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (normal value <240 IU/L), -glutamyl transpeptidase (-GT) (normal value <32 IU/L) activities, and total and conjugated bilirubin concentrations were measured using routine automated techniques. Total BA, cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), CDCA, and UDCA in their free, glycol, and tauro derivative forms were assessed using capillary electrophoresis in a subsample of 40 cases and 38 controls. The details of the analytical method have been published elsewhere.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the white blood peripheral cells (WBC) from a blood sample using a standard method as previously described.
After digestion of genomic DNA with the methylation-sensitive endonuclease HpaII, the methylation status of candidate gene promoters was assessed using a real-time quantitative PCR assay as described elsewhere. Leukocyte HpaII-digested DNA and undigested DNA were PCR amplified with primers specific to each selected region of the candidate gene promoters; the primer sequences are listed in Table S1. An iCycler thermocycler (BioRad Hercules, CA, USA) was used for DNA methylation quantification, using SYBR Green (Invitrogen, Buenos Aires, Argentina) as a fluorescent dye. The results are expressed as the ratio of digested to undigested product in triplicate.
Putative methylation target at the 5-cytosine residues of the dinucleotide CpG in the gene promoter of FXR/NR1H4 (358 and 1890), PXR / NR1I2 (471 and 1224), NR1I3 (2377), ESR1 (173), and ABCC2 (2438) located at positions relative to transcription starting site were explored. A sequence starting 2,500 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of candidate genes was used to search for regions with potentially methylated CpG sites. Each sequence was retrieved from the database of transcriptional start site at http://dbtss.hgc.jp/, with the following ID numbers: FXR/NR1H4 (NM_005123), PXR/NR1I2 (NM_003889.3), NR1I3 (NM_001077469.2), ESR1 (NM_001122742.1), and ABCC2 (NM_000392.3).
Huh7 human hepatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells seeded in 6-well plates at 50% confluence were treated with the following drugs: 5 µM 5-Aza-2-deoxicitidine (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, Saint Luis, MO, USA), an agent that inhibits DNA methylation, and 100 µM 5-Pregnan-3-OL-20-one sulfate, sodium salt, also known as epiallopregnanolone sulfate PM5S (Catalog ID P3865-000, Steraloids, Newport, RI, USA). The culture supernatant was harvested 3 days after treatment and centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 min at 4°C and stored at 70°C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH: 8.0; 0.05 M NaCl; 0.5% NP40; and 1 mM EDTA). From these supernatants, RNA and DNA were extracted immediately using trizol methods. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTS/PMS colorimetric method. The cells were incubated with MTS/PMS in the shelter of the light at 37°C. After an hour of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
For statistical analyses, STATISTICA program was applied with P<0.05 regarded as statistically significant. Normally distributed data were tested using Pearson correlations, Student's t-tests, or analysis of variance, depending on homogeneity of the variance. For non-normally distributed data, Spearman correlations, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used. In particular, Wilcoxon matched paired test was used to compare variables, such as the methylation levels in two positions of the same promoter. Normality of distribution was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All tests were two-tailed. Categorical data were tested using chi-square test.
