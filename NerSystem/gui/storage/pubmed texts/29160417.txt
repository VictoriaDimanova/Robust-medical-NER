CASKI and C33A cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cell line authentication via STR profiling was performed to confirm their identity. In addition, cells were tested periodically for mycoplasma contamination by Mycosensor PCR assay (Agilent, USA). For radiotherapy, cells were exposed to -rays from a 60Co source (Theratron 780C; Theratronics International Limited, Canada) at a dose rate of 2.0 Gy/min.
In order to establish the radiosensitivity profile of each cell line, cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at a concentration of 150 cells per well. After 24 h, cells were irradiated (2, 4, and 6 Gy) and incubated for 72 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and allowed to proliferate in fresh medium for 10 more days. Colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h followed by irradiation (1.8 Gy). After 24h, cells were lysed and 50 µg of proteins from each sample were run on a 612% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF Hybond-P (GE Healthcare, Brazil) membrane. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against EGFR (1:500; #2232, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), ERCC1 (1:100; 8F1 clone, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), p53 (1:500; G5912 clone, BD Pharmingen, USA) and HSC70 (heat shock cognate 70 protein; 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). After incubation with secondary antibodies, immunoblots were detected using the ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, Brazil). Predicted molecular weights for EGFR, ERCC1, p53, and HSC70 are 170, 39, 53, and 70 kDa, respectively.
Cell lines were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h followed by irradiation (1.8 Gy). After 24 h of treatment, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). From each sample, 1.0 g of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA. Then, quantitative PCR was performed on the aliquots of the cDNA using Taqman Fast Real-Time PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The gene expression profile was evaluated using the ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Taqman gene expression assay references are Hs01076078_m1 (EGFR), Hs00157415_m1 (ERCC1), Hs00153349_m1 (TP53) and 4326317E (GAPDH). The 2CT method was utilized to analyze the fold increase.
Ten patients diagnosed with stage IIB-IVA cervical squamous cell carcinoma, age 1870 years, and clinical indication for radiotherapy were enrolled. All patients provided written informed consent before participation. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (CEP-INCA) under registry 143/09 and followed the Helsinki Declaration.
A prospective trial included locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients. Briefly, all 10 patients were treated with teletherapy - 45Gy divided into 25 fractions, which means that each fraction is equivalent to 1.8 Gy. This dose was the same used in cell culture experiments previously described. A tumor biopsy was performed before treatment and a second biopsy was taken 24 h after the first radiotherapy fraction. Cisplatin, when indicated, was prescribed afterwards. The expression pattern of EGFR, ERCC1, and p53 was compared between malignant tissues before treatment and after the first teletherapy with 1.8 Gy dose.
For immunohistochemistry, TMA was constructed, as described by Pires et al.. All samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Serial TMA sections were cut, mounted on glass slides and dried at 56°C before dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in alcohol. All sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer followed by inhibition of endogenous peroxidase (peroxidase block, RE7101, Novocastra, UK). Incubation of primary antibodies against EGFR (D38B1, 1:25, Cell Signaling Technology), ERCC1 (1:100; 8F1 clone, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or p53 (1:100; G5912 clone, BD Pharmingen) was performed for 1 h. Slides were incubated with NovoLink¢ polymer (RE7112, Novocastra), further developed with diaminobenzidine chromogen (RE7105, Novocastra), and finally stained with Mayer hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with Canadian balsam. EGFR, ERCC1 and p53 expressions were evaluated semi-quantitatively as positive cells after counting 300500 tumor cells, being scored as negative (no staining), 1+ (<25% of positive cells), 2+ (2575% of positive cells) or 3+ (>75% cells staining positively). Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody.
Only samples with at least 70% of malignant cells were sent to DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues with NucleoSpin FFPE DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. TP53 exons 59 were amplified by PCR using primers and cycling parameters according to International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) protocol. The PCR products were then purified with Illustra GFX PCR DNA and gel Band Purification kit (GE Healthcare, Brazil) and directly sequenced in both directions in the ABI 3130XL DNA sequence analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the same primers and Big-Dye 3.1 Terminator cycle sequencing chemistry (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The electropherograms were visualized manually on the program Sequencher 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, USA).
Quantitative experiments comparing two conditions in cell culture were analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test. Immunohistochemistry comparing score intensity between EGFR, p53 and ERCC1 staining before and after radiotherapy was analyzed by paired Student's t-test. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software (USA) and the P values were considered significant when <0.05.
