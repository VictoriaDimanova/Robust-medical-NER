iPSC culture condition, neuronal differentiation, neurosphere, and neuronal culture were described previously. Generally, experiments were done with neurons at 8-days postdifferentiation, except for the electrophysiology experiments, where the neurons were matured for 7 to 8 weeks.
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and permeabilized/blocked with 10% goat serum/0.1% Triton X-100 detergent for 1 hour at ambient temperature (all in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight or at ambient temperature. After three 5-minute washes, secondary antibodies were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hour. After 3 more washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI (10g/ml) at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. All washes and incubations were performed in blocking buffer. Cells were imaged using an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) IX-70 inverted fluorescent microscope. Primary antibodies included -III tubulin (Tuj1; Covance, Princeton, NJ; 1:400), microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2; Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:500), and neuronal nuclei/FOX3 (NeuN; Millipore, 1:10), and secondary antibodies included antimouse Alexa 488 and antirabbit Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; both at 1:1,000).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions to measure GAA¢TTC repeat length were described previously. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the qScript One-Step SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit from Quanta Biosciences (Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturers instructions. qRT-PCR reactions were detected on a PTC-200 thermal cycler with the Chromo4 real-time module (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Primers to detect FXN mRNA were previously described. Primers for neuronal characterization were as follows: MAP2-R1 (5-CAGGAGTGATGGCAGTAGAC-3), MAP2-F2 (5-TTTGGAGAGCATGGGTCAC-3) for the MAP2 gene, HUC-F1 (5-GGTTCGGGACAAGATCACAG-3), and HUC-R1 (5-CTGAACTGGGTCTGGCATAG-3) for the ELAVL3 gene. qRT-PCR primers for pluripotency mRNA markers were as previously published. Neuronal cell gene expression profiling was performed on Illumina (San Diego, CA) HT12 arrays, and statistical analysis was as described in Ku et al.
Flow cytometry and quantitative Western analysis were performed as previously described. Antibodies used in flow cytometry were the following: Tuj1 (Covance, 1:2500), MAP2 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; 1:40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Millipore, 1:20), Tra181 (Millipore, 1:500), and SSEA3 (Millipore, 1:500). Secondary antibodies were antimouse Alexa 488 (1:1,000), antirat Alexa 488 (1:1,000), or antirabbit Alexa 647 (1:1,000). The following antibodies were used in quantitative Western analysis: frataxin (MitoSciences, Eugene, OR; 1:1,000), RPL13a (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; 1:2,000), and RNA polymerase II (Millipore; 1:2,000). Antibodies against acetylated residues of histone H3 and H4 have been described. The following secondary antibodies were all obtained from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) and used at the same dilution (1:5,000): antimouse IR680, antimouse IR800, antirabbit IR680, and antirabbit IR800.
Analyses of histone tail modifications on the FXN gene in neurons, iPSCs, and fibroblasts were performed as previously reported. Native chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as follows. PBMCs were resuspended at 8  106 cells/ml in ice-cold buffer N (15mM Tris pH 8, 15mM NaCl, 60mM KCl, 250mM sucrose, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM CaCl2, and protease inhibitors); 0.5% NP-40 was added, and cells were incubated on ice for 10 minutes to complete cell lysis. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 524  g for 5 minutes and resuspended in ice-cold buffer N. After determining the nucleic acid content by spectrophotometry, 1U of micrococcal nuclease was added per microgram of DNA and samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 10mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000rpm, and supernatant was collected and visualized on an agarose gel to determine the average DNA length. Chromatin (45g) was diluted in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) low salt buffer (20mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 140mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40), 1g of antibody against acetylated histone H3K9 (Millipore) was added, and samples were incubated at 4°C overnight. The next day, 60l of protein A agarose bead suspension (Millipore) was added, and samples were incubated for 2 hours at 4°C. Beads were then washed 3 times with ChIP low salt buffer and once with ChIP high salt buffer (same as ChIP low salt buffer but with 0.5 M NaCl). Chelex 100 resin (100l; 10% solution wt/vol in water; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was added to the beadimmunoglobulin G complexes, and samples were heated at 100°C for 10 minutes. Proteinase K was added (100g/ml), and samples were incubated at 55°C for 30 minutes, followed by heat inactivation at 100°C for 10 minutes. Supernatant was collected, and DNA recovery was analyzed by quantitative PCR using primers specific for the FXN region upstream of the GAA¢TTC repeat expansion in intron 1 (see Herman et al for primer sequences).
Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was performed using the EZ DNA methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA), following manufacturer instructions. Bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified using the following primers: for the sequence upstream of the GAA¢TTC repeats, 5-GTTGTGGGGATGAGGAAGATTT TT-3 and 5-TAATCCACCTTCCTAAACCTCCCA-3; for the sequence downstream of the GAA¢TTC repeats, primer sequences were described in Al-Mahdawi et al. PCR amplicons were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and 20 clones per amplicon were sequenced.
Conventional whole cell patch clamp techniques were used for dissociated cells plated on poly-d-lysine and laminin matrigelcoated glass coverslips. Coverslips containing neuronal iPSCs were placed on the stage of a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Eclipse Ti inverted stage microscope for patch clamp recordings. Recordings were made using an Axon 700B Multiclamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Signals were sampled at 10kHz and filtered at 1.6kHz. Whole cell capacitance was fully compensated, and series resistance was compensated 60 to 70%. iPSC-derived neurons were identified based on morphology under bright field differential interference contrast. Coverslips of neuronal iPSCs were transferred to a recording chamber constantly perfused with bath solution consisting of (in millimolars): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Recording electrodes (tip resistance of 46M©) were filled with solution containing (in millimolars): 20 KCl, 100 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg2+-adenosine triphosphate, 0.3 sodium guanosine triphosphate, and 10 phosphocreatine (pH 7.3). For voltage clamp recordings, cells were clamped at 70mV; Na+ and K+ currents were stimulated by voltage step depolarizations. Command voltages varied from 90 to +50mV in 10mV increments. For current clamp recordings, action potentials (APs) were induced by stimulation steps from 0.2 to +0.5 nA. All recordings were performed at ambient temperature. Offline analysis of data was performed using the Clampfit (pCLAMP 10 software, v10.2 Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), and Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) programs.
HEKGFP560GAA cells, fibroblasts, and FRDA neurons were plated onto coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS and stored overnight in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Cells were then rehydrated in 50% formamide, 2 standard saline citrate (SSC) for 5 minutes at room temperature and hybridized overnight at 37°C in 100l of a solution containing 10% dextran sulfate, 2mM vanadylribonucleoside complex, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 100g yeast tRNA, 2 SSC, 50% formamide, and 1.2g Cy3-(TTC)10 probe. After hybridization and washing, nuclei were stained in Hoechst 33342 (1:200 dilution) for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent. Cells were imaged with a 63 objective on a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope.
Both RG2833 and placebo were produced, packed, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practice. RG2833 drug product capsules contained 30mg, 60mg, or 150mg of 109 free-base equivalent. Each capsule contained a blend of RG2833 active pharmaceutical ingredient (109) and Ac-Di-Sol (2% croscarmellose sodium).
A phase I crossover, escalating dose clinical study of orally administered RG2833 was performed in 20 adults with FRDA. The study consisted of 4 cohorts of 5 FRDA patients. Cohort 1 and 2 were open label, with single 30 to 120mg doses. Cohorts 3 and 4 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies. Cohort 3 received a single 180mg or placebo dose; Cohort 4 received two 120mg or placebo doses, 4 hours apart. Primary outcome was safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response on HDAC inhibition, and FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels in patient blood cells. All patients gave written informed consent according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol and consent forms were approved by the Italian Superior Health Institute (protocol No. 31637[11]PRE211101; EudraCT No. 2011-000248-12) and by the Ethical Committee of San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital (protocol No. 10090-25/05/12; file No. 172/2011). An independent data safety monitoring board reviewed major safety assessments and periodically assessed safety and efficacy. Data collection and monitoring, and safety reporting management were performed by independent expert contractors. The academic investigators vouch for the validity of the results.
Inclusion criteria included age 18 to 55 years inclusive; genotype confirmed for homozygous GAA¢TTC triplet expansion at FXN locus, with at least 100 repeats at the shortest allele; left ventricular ejection fraction ¥ 50% documented by echocardiogram or equivalent study within 1 year of day 1; and medically stable condition. Exclusion criteria included chronic or intermittent clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias at any time during the year prior to the screening visit; clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter ECG findings (including clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias) at the screening visit; history of significant allergic reaction or sensitivity; current or history of other clinically significant disease in the past 12 months prior to screening; use of any medication (excluding ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and oral contraceptives) or of any dietary aids or supplements known to modulate drug metabolizing enzymes within 24 hours prior to study drug administration; and treatment with an investigational drug, device, or biological agent within 90 days prior to screening. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1. Patients ECG telemetry was monitored for 72 hours starting 12 hours before drug administration, and 12-lead ECG was repeated every 6 hours during the day of drug administration and every 24 hours during the 4 in-hospital days.
Plasma samples were thawed, and protein was precipitated by addition of 9 volumes of acetonitrile. Supernatant was then transferred to a new tube containing 9 volumes of an ammonium acetate aqueous buffer. Samples were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using a Waters (Milford, MA) Acquity BEH C18 column with a water/acetonitrile gradient containing formic acid. Polarity of the mass spectrometer was set to positive mode, and the transition from 340.3 to 119.1amu was used to quantify RG2833. Pharmacokinetic parameters for RG2833 and metabolites in plasma were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Only plasma concentrations greater than the respective lower limit of quantification (LOQ) were used in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax were taken directly from the data. The elimination rate constant, lz, was calculated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log-linear segment of the plasma concentrationtime curve. The slope was determined from a linear regression of the natural logarithm of the terminal plasma concentrations against time; at least 3 terminal plasma concentration time points, beginning with the final concentration greater than LOQ, were selected for the determination of lz, and the regression had to have a coefficient of determination (r2)¥0.9000. The range of data used for each patient was determined by visual inspection of a semilogarithmic plot of concentration versus time. Elimination half-life (t½) was calculated according to the following equation:  
Area under the curve (AUC) to the final sample with a concentration greater than LOQ [AUC(0-t)] was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity [AUC(inf)] using
  where Ctf and tf are the final concentration ¥ LOQ and the time at which it occurred.
Clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vz/F), uncorrected for bioavailability (F), were calculated for RG2833 according to
  respectively.
The levels of FXN transcript were measured with a SYBR green-based qRT-PCR assay. For whole blood analysis, total RNA was isolated from blood collected with PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and processed using PAXgene Blood RNA Kit IVD (QIAGEN). For RG2833 in vitro treated PBMC analysis, PBMCs were isolated from predose patient blood with Ficoll gradient and treated with RG2833 in culture for 24 hours. Cells were then pelleted, and RNA was isolated from the cell pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was then synthesized using the RT2 HT First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Valencia, CA). Twenty-five nanograms of cDNA was combined with RT2 FAST SYBR Green/ROX qPCR master mix, RT2 qPCR primer assay for FXN (PPH05744B, SABiosciences), and RT2 qPCR primer assay for TBP (PPH01091G, SABiosciences) in a 25l reaction volume. Assays were performed in duplicate using an Mx3005 or Mx3000 instrument and analyzed using MxPro Software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The amount of FXN mRNA in each sample was determined relative to the predose sample and normalized to the levels of TBP mRNA.
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood using BD (Franklin Lakes, NJ) Vacutainer CPT tubes, following manufacturer instructions. Erythrocytes were lysed by treatment with buffer EL (QIAGEN). PBMCs isolated at the clinical site were lysed with lysis buffer (25mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137mM NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL CA-630) on ice for 20 minutes. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation, and cell lysate protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Frataxin protein was determined with a dipstick assay, as described. HDAC deacetylase assay was performed using a 96-well microplate assay by incubating cell lysate containing 0.5mg/ml of protein with 50mM of Fluor de Lys substrate (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA) at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. At the end of the incubation, equal volume of stop solution (10mg/ml trypsin with 2mM trichostatin A) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Fluorescence was then measured at excitation wavelength 360nm and emission wavelength 460nm. The level of deacetylase activity in each dosed PBMC sample was determined as a percentage of the predose sample fluorescence.
