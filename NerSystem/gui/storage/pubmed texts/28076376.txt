This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research (IRB) at the Medical University of South Carolina. All participants were adult ages above 20 and provided written consent. In the current study, 12 healthy controls and 24 HIV+ ART-treated aviremic HIV-infected subjects were evaluated in a cross sectional study. The clinical characteristics of healthy controls, 13 immunologic responders, and 11 immunologic non-responders are shown in Table 1 and S1 Table.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated over a Ficoll-Hypaque cushion (GE, Pittsburgh, PA) from EDTA-contained blood, aliquot, and stored at -80°C before use. Antibodies were incubated with PBMC at 4°C for 30 min for surface staining. After surface staining, the cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. The following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies were used (clone): anti-human CD3-percp (OKT3), anti-CD56-APC (B-159), anti-CD16-PEcy7 (3G8), anti-human CD4-BV421 (RPA-T4), anti-human CD107a-BV500 (H4A3), anti-human CD38-FITC (HIT2), anti-human HLA-DR-PE (G46-6), anti-human NKG2D-BV500 (1D11), and Ghost Red 780 (Tonbo Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Mouse IgG1-BV500, IgG1-APC and IgG2a-PE isotype antibodies were used to gate on CD107a/NKG2D-BV500, CD38 and HLA-DR respectively. Cells were collected by BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Version 10.0.8).
NK cell-mediated CD4+ T cell cytotoxicity was assessed by flow cytometry. Briefly, purified CD4+ T cells from the same healthy control donor were co-cultured with or without purified NK cells at a 1:3 ratio in 96-well V-bottom plates (Corning). Cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, spun at 300 g for 1 min, and incubated for 6 h at 37°C. After incubation, cells were surface stained with antibodies against CD3, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde solution containing a constant number of flow cytometry particles (5*104/ml) (AccuCount blank particles, 5.3 m; Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL). A constant number of particles (2.5*103) were counted during cytometry acquisition in order to normalize the number of CD4+ T cells. The percentage of CD4+ T cell cytolysis was calculated using the formula: %cytolysis = [(number of CD3+ T cells in the absence of NK cells)(number of CD3+ T cells in the presence of NK cells)]/(number of CD3+ T cells in the absence of NK cells) *100.
All data were analyzed and graphed using Prism software (GraphPad 6.0) and SPSS (Version 23). Statistical significance between two groups was determined by the Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric). In the pre-specified hypothesis, we were interested in the comparisons of HIV+ immunologic non-responders versus HIV+ immunologic responders or healthy controls; therefore, p-values from comparing HIV+ immunologic non-responders to each of control groups were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Associations between pairs of continuous variables were analyzed by Spearman Correlation test. Partial correlation (controlling for age, sex, and frequency of CD38+ on CD4+ T cells) between CD4+ T cell counts and NK cell activation was analyzed using SPSS (Version 23).
