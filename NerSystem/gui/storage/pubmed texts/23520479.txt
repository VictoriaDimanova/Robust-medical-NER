The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1650 was obtained from the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and was cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C, in a DMEM solution containing 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin. The erlotinib-resistant cell line (H1650ER) was established by exposing parental cells to increasing concentrations of erlotinib, up to 10 µM, for several months. The resistant cells were continuously maintained in a medium containing 10 µM of erlotinib prior to each experiment.
Mouse antiE-cadherin antibody(sc-21791) and monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody(sc-53464), Mouse anti-actin antibody(sc-47778), Rabbit antiN-cadherin antibody (sc-59987), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody(sc-53800), and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (sc-53464) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Akt(#9272), S473 p-Akt(#4060), EGFR(#2239), and p-42/44 MAPK(#4695) were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). EGFR [pY1068] (CB11007889) and Rabbit antiErk antibody(CB1241938) were purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO.).
Cell proliferation assays were measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Santa Clara,CA), which uses the bioreduction of 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium sodium (WST-8) to orange-colored formazan to measure cell viability. Briefly, 100 µl of H1650 and H1650ER cells, at 2104/ml, were incubated with different concentrations of erlotinib in 96-well culture plates for 48 hours. Next, the culture medium in the 96-wells was replaced with fresh medium containing 5% CCK-8 reagent; after an hour, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured and the values were corrected by subtracting the absorbance of control wells that did not contain cells.
Tissues from 13 cases of lung adenocarcinoma, from both before and after erlotinib treatment, were collected between January 2008 and July 2011 in Henan Provincal Peoples Hospital, and embedded in paraffin. Tumor tissue slides were de-paraffinized and dehydrated using Slide Brite (Sasco Chemical Group, Inc.). Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.05 M Glycine-HCL buffer, pH 3.5, containing 0.01% (w/v) EDTA, at 95°C for 20 min and stained with an antibody against human E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin, which are same as for the in vitro assays,. The evaluation of immunostaining of these sections was made blind to two trained pathologists who were unaware of the clinical background of the samples. The intensity of E-cadherin,vimentin and N-cadherin were scored and placed into four categories according to staining: 0 for 0%; 1 for 133%; 2 for 3466%; and 3 for 67100%. All of the 13 human tissues involved in our study were carried out according to the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 and all subsequent revisions. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Henan provincial peoples hospital, Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for N-cadherin was purchased from Invitrogen. The sequence used for the N-cadherin interfering RNAs (siRNA) was 5-CUAACAGGGAGUCAUAUGGUGGAGC-TdT-3. To minimize nonspecific effects of interfering RNAs, non-targeting control siRNA, also purchased from Invitrogen, was used as negative control. The siRNA transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturers instructions. The experiment was repeated at least three times, independently.
Cells were treated with N-cadherin-specific siRNAs for 48 hours to knockdown N-cadherin expression. Invasion was observed using transwell culture inserts with a 6.5 mm diameter and 8 µm pore filters (Greiner Bio-One SAS, Courtaboeuf, France). Then, 3104 cells in 100 µl RPMI medium, with 1% FCS were seeded in the upper compartment, and 600 µl RPMI, with 10% FCS were added to the lower chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hours at 37°C. After removing cells on the upper side of the transwell, cells on the underside were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (Becton Dickinson) and were lysed with 10% acetic acid for quantification by densitometric measurement at 550 nm. Experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Proteins from the cell lysates, which were prepared using RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1% Nadeoxycholate (pH 7.4)] supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml aprotinin and 5 µg/ml leupeptin), were detected by SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to Immobilon membranes (Invitrogen); these membranes were subsequently probed with specific antibodies. The secondary antibodies used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and the membrane was developed using an ECL kit (Thermo). This experiment was repeated at least three times, independently.
The H1650 and H1650ER cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin and plated in 6-well plates at 1104 cells per well in 0.35% agarose in DMEM medium layered on top of 0.7% agarose in the same medium. Colony formation was observed after 23 weeks in culture. Following staining with 0.005% crystal violet, colonies were counted under a microscope. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The number of cells were counted and averaged to determine the cloning efficiency.
Cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with PBS. They were fixed for 10 min with cold methanol and washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were then blocked in a solution of PBS, 10% bovine serum, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The cells were incubated with primary antibody to either E-cadherin or to vimentin at 2 µg/ml for 1 h, then the cells were washed twice with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS, 5 or 10% bovine serum, and 0.1% Tween 20. After incubating on coverslips for 1 h at 37°C the coverslips were washed as described above and mounted on slides in medium containing DAPI.
Cancer cells were dissociated using 0.05% trypsin; they were washed with PBS and 100 µl aliquots of 105 cells in PBS were placed in 96-well V-bottom plates and incubated at RT for 1 h with IgG. Cells were washed twice with PBS. Following the washes with PBS, bound antibody was detected using goat anti-Human-PE or goat anti-Human-CY3, and analyzed by FACS (LSRII, Becton Dickinson).
The SPSS 13.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for data analyses. The significance of the difference among the covariates was determined by two-tailed v2 test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
