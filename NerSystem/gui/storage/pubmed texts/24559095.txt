Several patient cohorts were used in this study. The screening cohort consisted of 144 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer at Malm University Hospital during the years of 2001 and 2002. Ethical permission was obtained from the Lund University Regional Ethics Board and written consent was not required. Median follow-up time for the patients was 5.75 years and median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range 35-97 years). All patients were treated following surgery. This cohort was originally designed as a first-line breast cancer screening cohort for Human Protein Atlas antibodies and further details of the material may be viewed in references.
The randomised cohort consisted of 564 premenopausal patients presenting with invasive stage II breast cancer who were enrolled in a randomised controlled clinical trial, recruiting between the years of 1986 and 1991. The Lund University and Linkping University Regional Ethics Boards approved the initial randomised study, and there was no requirement for additional consent for the present study. Tumour material was available from 500 patients. The primary aim of the trial was to determine the effect of 2 years of tamoxifen treatment on recurrence-free survival compared to no treatment and patients were included regardless of ER status. Median follow-up time was 13.9 years and further details can be found in reference. Out of the 500 available tumours from the randomised cohort, 324 were successfully evaluated for YAP1 expression. Analysis of the missing tumour cores showed a slight correlation to PgR positivity (Spearmans rho 0.105, p=0.024), a lower NHG grade (Spearmans rho -0.110, p=0.013) and a low Ki-67 expression (Spearmans rho -0.122, p=0.012). No differences were found in breast cancer recurrences comparing the two groups.
For the gene expression analysis of 1107 primary breast cancers, a meta-analysis of six comprised Affymetrix datasets was performed as previously described. Endpoints for datasets Chin et al., Pawitan et al. and Sotiriou et al. was recurrence-free survival and for Desmedt et al., Ivshina et al. and Wang et al. datasets it was disease-free survival. In this study, we have referred to all endpoints as recurrence-free survival. The Affymetrix U133A probe set ID used for YAP1 was 213342_at. The classification of molecular breast cancer subgroups was made according to the Norway/Stanford signature. Further details of the datasets included in the analysis can be found in references.
The aCGH (array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation) patient data set consisted of 171 patients with primary operable breast cancer. The dataset is publicly available from NCBIs GEO under the series accession number GSE8757 and further details may be found in reference.
Tumours from the screening and randomised cohorts were assembled in tissue microarrays using a manual tissue arrayer (MTA-1; BeecherInstruments, Inc., Sun Prairie, WI). The pre-treatment process of deparaffinization, rehydration and epitope retrieval of the 4 m sections was carried out using the PT Link module (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Staining procedure with YAP1 antibody (1:25, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, cat#4912) was performed using the Autostainer Plus instrument with the Envision Flex programme (Dako). The epitope used for raising the YAP1 antibody includes amino acid 100 (personal communication, Cell Signaling Technology Europe B.V.) and should therefore detect all to date known isoforms of YAP1. YAP1 was scored as overall intensity as either absent, weak, intermediate or strong by a research associate (SL) and a pathologist (GL). Expression of ER, Ki-67, cyclin D1 and amplification of CCND1 (randomised cohort) had been scored previously in both the randomised and screening cohorts.
The human breast cancer cell line T47D (ATCC, Int., Manassas, VA) was maintained in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1xPEST (streptomycin 90 g/ml, penicillin 90 IU/ml). Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were seeded in PEST-free media which was subsequently replaced by PEST-free serum-free media and siRNA solution (OptiMEM, Gibco, Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), yielding a final siRNA concentration of 40 nM. For negative control, the ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting control siRNA #2 (#D-001810-02) was used and for targeting YAP1, two different siRNAs were used; ON-TARGETplus YAP1 #7 (#J-012200-07) and ON-TARGETplus YAP1 #8 (#J-012200-08) (Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). After five hours, transfection was discontinued by replacement of medium to regular serum medium.
The effect of 17-estradiol (E2) and 4-OH-tamoxifen was determined by use of WST-1 assay. T47D cells were seeded at a density of 400 000 cells in a 60 mm  culture dish (28.3 cm2) in PEST-free media and transfected the following day as described. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were re-seeded in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal stripped serum in a 96-well plate (5000 cells/well). After an additional 24 hours, cells were incubated at 37°C in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 1% charcoal stripped serum with either control treatment (EtOH), 1 nM 17-estradiol (E2) (Sigma #E2758, Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO) or 1 nM E2 and increasing concentrations of 4-OH-tamoxifen (10 nM, 100 nM and 1 M) (Sigma #H7904, Sigma-Aldrich Co), the active metabolite of tamoxifen, for 4 days. WST-1 assay reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was subsequently added (10 l) to each well and cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C before the absorbance of each well was measured at the wavelength of 450 nm and reference wavelength of 690 nm, using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (Synergy 2). Statistics were calculated using Students t-test assuming unequal variances and the meanSD (standard deviation) is presented. Each experiment was measured in triplicate and repeated five times.
For western blot analysis, cells were scraped in cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail Complete Mini and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail phosSTOP (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cell extracts were kept on ice for 30 minutes and vortexed every 10 min followed by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatants were subsequently collected and protein concentration was determined using the BSA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Twenty g of protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Primary antibodies used included YAP1 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, cat#4912), cyclin D1 (clone SP4, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), cyclin A2 (H432, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, cat#sc-751), and actin (I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, cat#sc-1616). For immunocytochemistry, cells were trypsinised and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min followed by staining with Meyers haematoxylin for 5 min. Cells were subsequently centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min and cell pellets were resuspended in 70% ethanol over night. Cell pellets were dehydrated in graded ethanol series, embedded in paraffin and a cell pellet array was constructed and stained using the following antibodies and dilutions: YAP1 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, 1:25, cat#4912), ER (clone 1D5, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, 1:50, cat#M7047) and PgR (clone 636, Dako, 1:1500, cat#M3569). The experiment was repeated three times and one representative experiment was quantified by automated image analysis.
T47D cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 100 000 cells per well and transfected with siCtr, siYAP1 #7 or siYAP1 #8 as described. Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, cells were re-transfected with 0.5 g pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid (pERE-luc) containing the ER binding element ERE (Estrogen Response Element) together with 0.2 g of the Renilla expressing plasmid pRL-TK, which served as an internal control. Five hours later, transfection media was replaced by phenol red-free DMEM, supplemented with 5% charcoal stripped serum and PEST, and cells were kept in this media 24 hours prior to treatment initiation. Cells were subsequently treated with either 1 nM 17-estradiol (E2) (Sigma #E2758, Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO) or 1 nM E2 and 100 nM 4-hydroxi-tamoxifen (4-OH-tam) combined (Sigma #H7904, Sigma-Aldrich Co). Ethanol was used as control treatment, mimicking the amount used for the E2 and E2+4-OH-tam wells. After 24 hours of treatment, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and normalised to the internal control. Three wells were included for each treatment in every experiment (n=3) and luciferase measurements were made in triplicate.
To examine statistical associations of YAP1 and clinical and molecular parameters, the non-parametric Spearmans rank correlation coefficient test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed. The p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing. Survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and recurrence-free survival was compared by means of the log-rank test. The IBM SPSS software program (version 20.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) was used for calculation.
Statistical significance of differences in tamoxifen response in cell viability experiments (WST-1) and luciferase experiments were calculated using an unpaired two-tailed students t-test assuming equal variances, unless stated otherwise. Bars indicate the mean of at least three independent experiments and error bars designateSD. Results were considered significant if p<0.05.
