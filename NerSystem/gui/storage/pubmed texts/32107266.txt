The study population consisted of 52 adolescent girls with PCOS (age, 15.6years; body mass index (BMI), 24.3kg/m2) who were enrolled into two randomized, open-label, controlled trials (with identical design) exploring the effects of OC versus SPIOMET treatment for 1year, with post-treatment ovulation rate as primary outcome. The results of the first trial (ISRCTN29234515) have been already published, and the second trial (ISCRCTN11062950) will be completed in 2019. Twenty-one out of the 52 girls belonged to the first study and 31 to the second trial; 31 of the 52 had available samples for CXCL14 assessment at 0 and 12 months (online supplementary figure 1). Both trials were performed at Sant Joan de D©u University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously. OC treatment consisted of 20µg of ethinylestradiol plus 100mg of levonorgestrel for 21/28 days and placebo for 7/28 days; SPIOMET is a low-dose combination of spironolactone 50mg/day, pioglitazone 7.5mg/day, and metformin 850mg/day. Twenty-one age-matched healthy girls recruited in nearby schools served as controls. All had regular menstrual cycles and none was hirsute or taking medications.
Birth weight and BMI (and their Z-scores) were retrieved, and endocrinemetabolic variables were assessed in the early morning, in the follicular phase (days 37) of the cycle, or after 2 months of amenorrhea. Serum glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipids, ultrasensitive C reactive protein (usCRP), sex hormone-binding globulin, androgens, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin were assessed as reported. CXCL14 levels in serum and cell culture medium were determined using a specific ELISA kit (RayBiotech), whose sensitivity was 0.7ng/mL, and interassay and intra-assay coefficients of variation less than 12%.
Body composition was assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry with a Lunar Prodigy and Lunar software (version 3.4/3.5; Lunar, Madison, Wisconsin, USA); abdominal (subcutaneous and visceral) and hepatic fat were assessed by MRI using a multiple-slice MRI 1.5 Tesla scan (Signa LX Echo Speed Plus Excite; General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). Central fat was arbitrarily defined as the sum of visceral fat (in squared centimeter) and hepatic fat (in per cent).
The effects of pioglitazone, spironolactone, and metformin on adipocytes were studied in human Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cells, a cell model of human beige (brown-like) adipogenesis. SGBS preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM)/F12 medium, 10% FBS. Adipogenic differentiation was initiated by incubating confluent cell cultures for 4 days in serum-free medium plus 20nM insulin, 0.2nM triiodothyronine, 100nM cortisol, 25nM dexamethasone, 500µM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, and 2µM rosiglitazone. Subsequently, the cells were switched to DMEM/F12, 20nM insulin, 0.2nM triiodothyronine, and 100nM cortisol and maintained for up to 10 days, when more than 90% cells have acquired differentiated adipocyte morphology. Two experimental designs were followed: (1) cells were treated with the medications across their differentiation process, in the absence of rosiglitazone and maintaining the drugs throughout the 10 days of differentiation and (2) adipocytes were treated with the drugs acutely (24hours), once the cells have been differentiated. Controls included a 1:1 methanol/dimethyl sulfoxide mixture (drug solvents) at <1/1000 concentration. Cell culture reagents and drugs were from Sigma. The cell culture medium was collected and concentrated 1:5 prior to measurement of CXCL14 levels. RNA was extracted from cells using an affinity column-based method (Machery-Nagel). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCRs were performed using 0.5µg RNA and employing TaqMan reagents and probes (Life Technologies), according to supplier indications. PCR was conducted in an ABI/Prism-7700 Sequence Detector System. The following TaqMan probes were used: CXCL14, Hs01557413; uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), Hs00222453; fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4), Hs00609791, and ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit 0 (RPLP0) mRNA, Hs99999902. Each sample was run in duplicate and the mean value was used to calculate the relative amount of individual mRNAs. Each mean value was normalized to that of the RPLP0 mRNA using the comparative (2-CT) method.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS V.23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Baseline differences in CXCL14 concentrations between patients and controls were tested with unpaired t-test; covariance analysis was used to adjust for age and BMI. Longitudinal changes between groups were compared by repeated-measures general linear model. Differences in longitudinal changes between groups were tested by the interaction term among between- and within-subject effects. Associations were sought by Pearson correlation analysis. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as meanSD.
The study was conducted after approval by the Institutional Review Board of Sant Joan de D©u University Hospital, after written consent by the parents and assent by each of the participants.
