The gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 was purchased from the Beijing Institute for Cancer Research (Beijing, China). The GC cell lines MKN-28, SGC-7901, AGS, MGC-803, MKN-45, and BGC-823 were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). These cells were maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 (MGC-803, BGC-823, MKN-28, SGC-7901), DMEM (GES-1) or F12 (AGS) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco BRL, NY, USA). All transfections used Lipofectamine 2000 ((Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA)).
All tissue samples used in the present study were collected from the Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, China). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Medical University Health Authority. The collection and use of tissues followed the procedures that are in accordance with the ethical standards as formulated in the Helsinki Declaration.
Tissue samples from 40 gastric cancer patients (23 male and 17 female; median age 59 years; range 4084 years) were used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Resected cancerous tissues (Tumor) and paired matched normal gastric tissues (Normal) were immediately cut, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at 80°C until RNA extraction.
The tissue microarrays (TMAs), consisting of 126 GCs and 41 adjacent normal stomach tissues, were used for in situ hybridization analysis. The median age of gastric cancer patients at diagnosis was 57 years (range 3182). The median follow-up time for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was 22 months and 15 months, respectively. All data of 126 GC samples, including age, sex, tumor site, histological grade, invasion depth (T stage), clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis were obtained from clinical and pathologic records and summarized in supplemental table 2.
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR reactions were performed by using a qSYBR-green PCR kit (Qiagen, Germantown, USA) and U6 snRNA was used as an endogenous control. Fold change was determined as 2ddCt. The Ct is the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence of each sample passes the fixed threshold. The ddCt was calculated by subtracting the dCt of the reference sample (paired non-tumor tissue for surgical samples and GES-1 cell for six gastric cancer cell lines) from the dCt of each sample. The sequences of the specific primers for miR-26a and U6 snRNA were 5-CTTCAAGTAATCCAGGATAGGC-3 and 5-ATTGGAACGATACAGAGAAGATT-3, respectively.
Detection of miR-26a by in situ hybridization utilizing the DIG-labelled locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based probe specific for miR-26a (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) was performed according to the manufacturers instructions and U6 snRNA was used as an positive control. Brieï¬y, tissue microarray slides were deparaffinized, treated with proteinase K (5 min in 2 µg/ml protease K), washed in PBS and subsequently blocked endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2. Hybridization was performed at 52°C overnight after the addition of 50 nM of DIG-labelled LNA probes, followed by a stringency wash in SSC buffers. After blocking (2% sheep serum and 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS with Tween-20) at room temperature, the probe-target complex was visualized utilizing an anti-DIG-POD antibody, and DAB complex.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarray sections using anti-FGF9 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The complex was visualized with streptavidin/peroxidase and DAB complex, and nuclei counterstained with hematoxylin. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results were scored by intensity (04) and the percentage of staining (0 to 100%). Relative expression was obtained by multiplying intensity by percentage. The slides were analyzed by two independent pathologists.
Recombinant lentiviruses containing miR-26a precursor or scramble sequences were purchased from SunBio (Shanghai, China). For luciferase analysis, the full-length FGF9 3-UTR was amplified from human blood genomic DNA and then cloned into the downstream region of a firefly luciferase cassette in pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The corresponding mutant constructs, in which the first six nucleotides complementary to the miR-26a seed-region were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). To construct FGF9-expressing vector, FGF9 ORF cDNA was purchased from GeneCopeia (Rockville, MD, USA) and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen).
miR-26a or scramble lentiviruses and pMIR-3UTR vector were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI) 24 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase expression for each sample. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
Western blotting was carried out as described previously. Briefly, protein lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and elec-trophoretically transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. Then, the membrane was incubated with mouse antibody against anti-FGF9 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labeled goat-antimouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and detected by chemiluminescence. -actin was used as a protein-loading control.
Cells were plated on 12-well plates at the desired cell concentrations. Cell counts were estimated by trypsinizing the cells and performing analysis using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) at the indicated time points in triplicate.
Cell migration was examined using wound-healing assays. An artificial wound was created on a confluent cell monolayer, and photographs were taken using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 24 hours.
For cell invasion assay, cells were seeded onto the basement membrane matrix present in the insert of a 24-well culture plate (EC matrix, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After a further 48 hours, the non-invading cells and EC matrix were gently removed with a cotton swab. Invasive cells located on the lower side of the chamber were stained with Crystal Violet, counted and imaged.
Six-well plates were covered with a layer of 0.6% agar in medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells (1104) were prepared in 0.3% agar and seeded in triplicate. After the plates were incubated at 37°C for two weeks, the colonies were counted.
The apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine staining (BD, USA) and analyzed with a FACS Calibur instrument (BD, USA). The collected data were analyzed using FlowJosoftware.
The gastric cancer model in nude mice was constructed as described before. To evaluate the role of miR-26a in tumor formation, SGC-7901 cells infected with miR-26a or scramble viruses were propagated and inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of nude mice (5 in each group). Tumor size was measured every 5 days. After 30 days, the mice were killed, necropsies were performed and the tumors were weighed. Tumor volumes were determined according to the following formula: AB2/2, where A is the largest diameter and B is the diameter perpendicular to A. To assay miR-26as effect on tumor metastasis, SGC-7901 cells infected with miR-26a or scramble viruses were injected into the tail vein of nude mice (6 in each group). After 45 days, necropsies were performed. Numbers of micrometastases in lung per HE-stained section in individual mice were analyzed by morphology observation. The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Research Protection Committee of Guangzhou Medical University. Standard animal care and laboratory guidelines were followed.
Comparisons between groups were analyzed by the t-test and x2 test. Overall survival curves and relapse-free curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test applied for comparison. Survival was measured from the day of surgery. Variables with a value of P<0.05 according to the univariate analysis were used in subsequent multivariate analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model. Spearmans correlation tests were used to evaluate the pairwise expression correlation between miR-26a and FGF9 in GC tissues. All differences were statistically significant at the level of P0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS15.0 software.
