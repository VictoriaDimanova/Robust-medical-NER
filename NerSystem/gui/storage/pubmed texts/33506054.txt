A total of 96 adult subjects, including 40 patients with ECRSwNP, 22 patients with nonECRSwNP, and 34 healthy control subjects, were enrolled into the study. The diagnosis of CRSwNP was strictly consistent with the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012. The diagnosis of asthma and AR were consistent with prior medical history and serum sIgE results. The definitions of both ECRSwNP and nonECRSwNP were in accordance with a previous study. Patients with acute upper or lower respiratory tract infections, patients who were treated with antibiotics or glucocorticoids in four weeks prior to the enrolment of the study, patients with severe uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active systemic/immunologic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and nephritis), and pregnant women were excluded. Control subjects were recruited from those who underwent septoplasty surgery merely because of anatomic variation but without any rhinosinusitis. No medication was used prior to sampling.
A total of 18 CRSwNP patients underwent a 2-week oral glucocorticoid treatment (24mg methylprednisolone, QD) prior to surgery. Polyp biopsies originated from the middle meatus of patients with CRSwNP were performed both before and after the oral glucocorticoid treatment. Postglucocorticoid polyp biopsies and uncinate mucosal tissue from healthy control subjects were collected during surgery. Detailed demographic and clinical information on smoking history, comorbidity of allergic rhinitis, and asthma and atopic data were collected on each participant on enrolment. Detailed information on demographical and clinical characteristics of subjects is provided in Table S1 and S2.
The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital and Beijing Institute of Otolaryngology, and all participants provided written informed consent before entry into the study.
Nasal tissue samples of eosinophilic CRSwNP (n = 6), nonECRSwNP (n = 6), and healthy control (n = 6) were performed RNA sequencing. Briefly, total RNA was extracted and purified with an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantity and quality of the isolated RNA were determined with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2100 TapeStation Automated Electrophoresis System (Agilent Technologies). RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform, and 150bp paired-end reads were generated by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Cooperation (Beijing, China).
The analyses of RNA sequencing data were performed as previously described. An adjusted P < 0.05 plus fold change > 2 was used as the cut-off for significantly differentially expressed mRNAs. All the genes included in Gene Ontology term antimicrobial humoral response (accession number 0019730) were determined for significantly differential expression between the eosinophilic CRSwNP group and the control group and between the noneosinophilic CRSwNP group and the control group. Transcripts Per Million (TPM) of mRNAs were used to represent the RNA abundance. The 10 most abundant AMPs differentially expressed in CRSwNP compared to healthy controls were selected for further analyses.
In total, samples from 18 subjects (6 ECRSwNP patients, 6 nonECRSwNP patients, and 6 control subjects) were processed for preparation of serial sections of Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB/PAS) staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining, and samples from 33 subjects (13 ECRSwNP, 7 nonECRSwNP, and 13 control subjects) were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and AB/PAS staining for assessment of glands and goblet cell hyperplasia in the samples. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining for BPIFB2 (13461-2-AP, Proteintech, China), CLU (ab92548, Abcam, UK), and SLPI (ab17157, Abcam, UK) were performed using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA was extracted using the MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of the total RNA were assessed with the NanoDrop 2000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass), and cDNA was subsequently synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was then performed with the SYBR Green method (TaKaRa Biotechnology) to evaluate the amount of mRNA for the AMPs of interest. The primer sequences for each gene used in the study are listed in Table S3.
Nasal secretion from 21 patients with ECRSwNP, 11 patients with nonECRSwNP, and 16 healthy volunteers was obtained and processed as previously described. Briefly, the nasal secretion was collected by inserting a sponge pack in the common meatus for 5 minutes. Then, the sponge was collected in a centrifugal tube and added 1 milliliter of normal saline. After incubation at 4°C for 2 hours, tubes were centrifugated with the speed of 1500rpm for 8 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C for further analysis. Protein levels of SLPI and CLU in nasal secretion were measured using SimpleStep ELISA kits ab263890 and ab174447, from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The nasal tissue culture and stimulation were performed as previous study. Nasal tissues collected from patients with CRSwNP which consist of nasal mucosa and submucosa were cut thoroughly in RPMI 1640 medium. Tissue fragment was achieved by passing through a mesh and then was resuspended in the culture medium, ready for further stimulating experiments. Also, A549 lung adenocarcinoma tumor cells were cultured as submersion cultures in DMEM until passaged. Nasal tissue fragment suspension and the passaged A549 cultures were stimulated by incubation for 48 hours in the presence of budesonide (1g/mL) and several cytokines, including IL-4 (50ng/mL, PeproTech), IL-13 (50ng/mL, R&D systems), IL-1 (10ng/mL, R&D Systems), IFN- (50ng/mL, R&D Systems), and TGF-1 (10ng/mL, R&D Systems), and at the end of this incubation period, the cells from each culture were harvested for analysis of SLPI and CLU by real-time PCR as detailed above.
Data were analyzed using the SPSS V.19 software package (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Graphs were performed with GraphPad Prism V.7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics were used for general information of the study population, and distribution of the data was assessed for normality. Results were expressed as mean  standarddeviation (SD). The Mann-Whitney U test or Student t test was used to analyze the differences depending on the normality of data distribution. For paired data, the Wilcoxon rank test was performed. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
