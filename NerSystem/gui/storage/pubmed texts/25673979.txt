This is a monocentric, double-blinded, controlled, and randomized interventional study on the effects of a technique called M©cano-Stimulation¢.
Thirty healthy subjects (20 females and 10 males) aged 3550 years were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were Fitzpatrick skin phototype IIV, with mild-to-moderate facial skin sagging (cutaneous sagging grade 13, according to Ezure et al) (Figure 1).
Exclusion criteria were sun or ultraviolet (UV) exposure during the last 15 days, any facial dermatologic pathologies such as rosacea, any chronic or acute systemic affections, any topical or systemic treatment that could interfere with the results of the study, and any contraindications to the M©cano-Stimulation (eg, herpes, vitiligo, acne: inflammatory and infective phase). All volunteers signed an informed consent form in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki after having enough time to understand the modalities and the aim of the study. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee (CPP [Comit©s de Protection des Personnes] Est II) and the National French Health Authorities (ANSM [LAgence nationale de s©curit© du M©dicament et des produits de sant©]).
The treatment was applied on one side of the face (randomized hemiface: chin, nasolabial fold, cheek, cheekbone, temple, forehead) during 15 minutes, three times per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions). In order to standardize the treatment, all treatments were performed by the same practitioner. The treatment was carried out via the M©cano-Stimulation system (LPG Systems, Valence, France), which transforms manual massage movements through mechanical procedures by means of different treatment heads. The treatment heads used in this study are composed of two motorized flaps inside a treatment chamber, which are dedicated to the treatment of the face or small areas. The treatment forces are exerted without any pinching or twisting of the skin but through combining both horizontal and vertical stimulation (Figure 2). These heads contain a small engine allowing the flaps to vibrate in a regular repeated way, which is accompanied with aspiration.
Different parameters (intensity and rhythm of the aspiration and beating frequency of the flaps) can be modulated at any time according to the individual sensitivity and tissue state (infiltrated, loosened, or wrinkled skin).
Lift heads used in this study were motorized: heads contain a small engine allowing the flaps to beat in a regular and permanent way, synchronized specifically with the sequential aspiration.
Evaluations were performed before the treatment (T0), after 24 sessions (T1), and 1 month after the end of the treatment (T2). Volunteers were evaluated in the standard skin situation (last face washing the night before measuring sessions, without any cosmetic application until the measures [no water, soap, cream, or makeup]). During the study, they were also asked to not change their facial skin care habits, hygiene, and cosmetic products, to avoid sun exposure and UV treatment even occasionally, to avoid any medical and invasive treatment on the face, and to report systemically any medication consumption to the investigator. All evaluations and measurements were performed under standard conditions (constant temperature 20°C23°C and hygrometry 40°C60°C) after a 20-minute rest period.
The main evaluation criterion was clinical scoring for skin sagging using a photographic scale. The secondary outcomes were clinical scoring of skin relief and wrinkles, skin color and radiance, and subject self-assessments. The biopsies were taken from both sides of the face (treatment and control side) from 19 subjects, nine for histopathologic changes and ten for the in vitro evaluation of the fibroblasts for their contractile capacity.
The primary outcome, measured at T0 and T1, was the facial skin sagging quotation performed by a blinded dermatologist, thanks to a clinical scoring based on the six-grade scale of Ezure et al and carried out on three different locations: upper part of the cheek/nasolabial folds (B zone), lower part of the cheeks (C zone), and lateral part of the cheek (D zone), as described in Figure 1.
Skin radiance: A clinical scoring of skin radiance was calculated through a visual analysis scale (CLBT¢) which includes seven descriptors. Actually, four different colors (pink red, olive, beige, light pink) between 10% and 100% lead to the final analysis of three different parameters (skin transparency, brightness, and luminosity) on a 010 scale.
Skin relief: An analogical 09 scale was used to evaluate the skin relief parameters. This allowed the calculation of a skin relief score defined as the sum of the following scores: surface irregularity score + wrinkles/lines/blemishes score + skin texture score + under-eye dark circles score + papules/microcysts score. The lower the score indicates lower skin relief, indicating better appearance.
Skin color: The same 09 scale was used to evaluate the skin color through the following parameters: heterogeneity, eye circle, redness/rosacea, skin spots, and papules/scars. The sum of these parameters present the global color score.
A blinded dermatologist evaluated the different signs of skin aging, with each criterion being assessed on both treated and nontreated side. 
wrinkles and fine lines;
roughness;
nasolabial folds;
elasticity;
firmness/softness;
radiance;
under-eye dark circles.
The volunteers were asked to fill a 9-point questionnaire at T0 (before) and T1 (after 24 sessions of treatment) for the following parameters (absence/presence and the intensity): 
They were also asked to compare their skin with pretreatment status for firmness, elasticity, smoothness, wrinkles, sagging, and brightness. They were supposed to answer the satisfaction questionnaire as well.
At each visit, the front, left, and right lateral photographs were taken of the whole and lower face in normal daylight, with eyes closed (Canon EOS Rebel XS with a 50-mm lens and two flashes positioned on a Faraghan Medical System). All photos were standardized for light (using Gretag MacBeth Colour Checker Chart) and position (stereotaxic table; Eotech SA, Marcoussis, France).
Two 2 mm punch biopsies were taken from nine subjects (four males and five females) from both sides of the face (treatment and control side) at T1. The samples were placed in sterile gauze moistened with saline and immediately treated: Each biopsy was placed in a 25 cm2 culture dish and was allowed to adhere to the plastic surface for approximately 30 minutes at 37°C. Three milliliters of Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 40 mg/mL of gentamicin, and 2 mg/mL of fungizone (DMEMc) were added to each dish. The dishes were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Subculture of fibroblasts was established after 34 weeks of outgrowth by trypsination (trypsin-EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetique) [1x]; PAA laboratory, France) of explant cultures. The culture medium was changed two times a week. Fibroblasts cultivated in passages lower than ten were used.
Fibroblasts that were either subjected or not subjected to M©cano-Stimulation were embedded in three-dimensional hydrated collagen, using a modified version of the technique developed by Bell et al, to study their mechanical behavior by measuring their capacity to contract free-floating lattices. Collagen lattices were made by mixing six volumes of 1.76 concentrated medium, three volumes of rat tail type I collagen solution (2 mg/mL), and one volume of fibroblasts suspension (8105 cells/mL). This mixture was poured into plastic Petri dishes (60 mm diameter). The gel polymerized in <30 minutes at 37°C. Culture medium was then added and changed every 48 hours. To measure the retracted lattice diameter, the culture dishes were placed on a transparent metric scale. The measurement of the lattice diameter was performed for 10 days. The evaluation of the migratory capacities of fibroblasts makes it possible to show the possible reorganization of extracellular matrix in the presence of M©cano-Stimulation.
The cell chamber was composed of eight rectangular culture cavities in which the lattices developed. Two silicon beams were placed opposite to each other with strain gauges hanging apart, down into each cavity at 27 mm distance. The lattice was attached to this sensor through a grid directly etched onto the lower part of the beams. The output signal from the strain gauges was amplified, then converted, and collected by a computer, which included an acquisition card and a specific software giving the forces in real time. Fibroblasts were prepared as defined in the previous paragraph; the lattice mixture was poured into a rectangular culture cavity of the GlaSbox and polymerized in <30 minutes at 37°C. Two milliliters of culture medium was added. The GlaSbox was then placed into a humidified incubator at 37°C, and force measurements were started immediately and for 24 hours. The results were expressed as contractile forces (arbitrary unit) of the fibroblasts either subjected or not subjected to M©cano-Stimulation according to the time. These measurements quantify the contractile forces of fibroblasts and make it possible to know whether a treatment applied for 15 minutes, three times per week during 8 weeks (24 sessions) already shows a lifting effect at the scale of fibroblasts.
Fibroblasts either subjected or not subjected to M©cano-Stimulation were seeded in 12-cavity plates at 0.04106 cells per cavity. The plates were incubated at 37°C. The next day, 500 L of DMEMc was poured into each cavity and the plates were incubated at 37°C. After 48 hours, the supernatant part was placed in a protease inhibitor cocktail (10% v/v, Merck Millipore, Fontenay sous bois, France). The samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
The quantification was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (USCN, Life Science and RayBiotech, Inc). Standards or samples were added into the precoated cavities with a specific biotin-conjugated antibody. After washing the samples, avidin (collagen I and hyaluronic acid) or streptavidin (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were added to each cavity and then incubated. After adding the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution, only those cavities that contained study substances showed a color change. The enzymesubstrate reaction is terminated by the addition of sulfuric acid solution and the color change is measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. The concentration is then determined by comparing the optical density of the samples to the standard curve.
The total soluble elastin was assayed by a colorimetric method (Fastin¢ Elastin Assay; Biocolor). The samples were precipitated with a solution of trichloroacetic acid and arginine, then the reagent 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21,23-porphine tetra-sulfonate was added, which can particularly bind to elastin. The formed complex was dissociated by a solution of guanidine-HCl and propan-1-ol. The developed color was measured at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiscan EX; Thermo).
Two-millimeter punch biopsies were taken under local anesthesia (1% xylocain) from the jugular area of ten other subjects (five males and five females) at T1. Biopsies from the treated and nontreated sides were coded and examined pair by pair in a blinded manner.
Each biopsy was cut into small fragments, some of which were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the others in 2% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer at 4°C for 3 days. For standard morphological examination, the glutaraldehyde-fixed fragments were washed and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 hours. After dehydration in graded ethanol series, the fragments were impregnated and embedded in epoxy resins (60°C for 3 days). Ultrafine sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation.
The paraformaldehyde-fixed fragments, used for immunocytochemistry, were washed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin (UVA polymerization at 4°C; EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA). Ultrafine sections on formvar-coated nickel grids (EMS) were exposed to the -SM-actin antibody (diluted 1/50, overnight at 4°C), washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 hour with goat anti-mouse antibodies coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold (diluted 1/10; Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). After final washes in PBS and distilled water, the sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate alone.
Transmission electron microscopy of all specimens was performed, and digital images were obtained and analyzed. Density and overall quality of the dermal fibrous structures, ie, collagen bundles and elastic fibers, were evaluated semiquantitatively. Also, the morphological signs of fibroblast metabolic and secretory activity as well as the intensity of the -SM-actin expression were noted.
Data are presented as mean  standard deviation. The normality of the data distribution was tested with a ShapiroWilk test. Differences between groups at baseline and at the end of the 24 sessions were tested with a Students t-test for paired values (or a Wilcoxon test in case of nonnormally distributed data).
Variance analysis with repeated measurements (analysis of variance) completed by a StudentNewmanKeuls test (normal distribution of parameters) or a Friedman test completed by a Dunns test (abnormal distribution of parameters) was applied to analyze the evolution of the studied parameters over the chosen time period.
Statistical significance was set at 5% and at 5%10% for trends.
For the in vitro study, one-way variance analysis followed by a Fishers exact test (if needed) was performed for synthesis studies. Two-way analysis of variance (groups and time) followed by a Fishers exact test (if needed) was performed for the measurements of migratory capacities and contractile forces.
