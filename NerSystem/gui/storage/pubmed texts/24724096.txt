The human HCC cell lines MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 (Shanghai fmgbio, Shanghai, China) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitorgen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified incubator at 37 with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 40 pairs of fresh samples from HCC were recruited from surgical specimens collected from 2007 to 2013, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. The current study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee and signed informed consent was obtained. None of the recruited patients received treatment before surgery, and for all patients clinical-pathological information was available.
Total RNA of cells was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reversely transcripted into cDNAs by PrimeScript one-step RT-PCR kit (TAKARA, Dalian, China). The expression of let-7g was measured by qRT-PCR assays. All samples with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TAKARA, Dalian, China), U6 expression was assayed for normalization, and relative gene expression determinations were made with the comparative delta-delta CT method (2Ct). The reaction mixtures of let-7g and U6 were incubated at thermal cycling conditions comprised 95°C for 30sec, and 40 cycles at 95°C for 5sec followed by 56.5°C for 30sec. The primers used for quantitative RT-PCR were provided in Supplementary Table1 (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/742417).
Expression of let-7g in 40 paired of HCC tissues and normal controls were detected by ISH with probes for let-7g (Exiqon, Woburn, Massachusetts). Melted paraffin was in an oven at 60°C for 45min then stored as slides overnight (O/N) at 4°C. Deparaffinized slides were in xylene and ethanol solutions at room temperature and then incubated with Proteinase-K for 10min at 37°C. Slides were hybridized with 20nmol/L let-7g probe in a hybridization buffer for 2h at 55°C then washed with SSC buffers. The remaining procedures were performed with a modified version of the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and visualized under a microscope. Each slide was examined by an observer blinded to the diagnosis and clinicopathologic data and reviewed and confirmed by a second blinded observer. Staining intensity and percentage of positive cells were noted as follows: four grades were used for the staining intensity (0: no intensity; 1: weak intensity; 2: moderate intensity; 3: strong intensity), and four grades were used for the percentage of positive cells (0: less than 10%; 1: between 10%25%; 2: between 25%40%; 3: more than 40%). HCC patients were classified into two groups according to the total score of staining intensity plus percentage of positive cells: low expression group (total score: 02) and high expression group (total score: 36), in order to better analyze the prognosis between groups.
Plasmid vector pCMV-let-7g harboring let-7g precursor and scramble sequence were purchased from OriGene (SC400010, OriGene, USA). MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 cells were grown to 8090% confluence in 6-well plates and were transfected with 4.0g of pCMV-let-7g or scramble control vector together with 10L Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA). All groups were performed in triplicate. Cells were lysed for RNA at 48h and protein at 72h after transfection.
Seventy-two hours after transfection, MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 cells were harvested in RIPA Lysis buffer (Bioteke, Beijing, China) and 80g of cellular protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE separation. Proteins were transferred to PVDF microporous membrane (Millipore, Boston, MA, USA) and blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody against K-Ras (#3339), ERK1/2 (#4695), p-ERK1/2 (#4370), Snail (#4719), E-cadherin (#3195), N-cadherin (#4061), and HMGA2 (#8179); they were all from cell signaling technology (Cell Signaling Technology, USA). -Tubulin (sc-9104), GAPDH (sc-25778), Bax (sc-20067), Bak (sc-1035), and Bcl-xL (sc-8392) were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). -Tubulin and GAPDH were chosen as an internal control. the blots were visualized using WesternBreeze Kit (WB7105, Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA), and further quantified using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) by measuring the band intensity for each group and normalizing to -Tubulin and GAPDH as internal control. The final results were expressed as fold changes by normalizing the data to the control values.
The methyl thiazolyl blue tetrazolium (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) spectrophotometric dye assay was used to detect cell proliferation ability. MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5  103cells per well. After transfection experiments, cell proliferation was assessed. Cells were incubated for 4h in 20L MTT at 37°C. The color was developed by incubating the cells in 150L dimethyl sulfoxide, the absorbance was detected at 490nm wave length. The data were obtained from three independent experiments.
Cell migration was assayed using the wound healing assay. MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 cells were plated in 6-well plate at a concentration of 5  105cells/well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer for 24h. After transfection, the monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip (10L) then washed with serum free medium to remove the floating and detached cells and photographed (time 0h, 24h and 48h) using inversion fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). Cell culture inserts (24-well, pore size 8m; BD Biosciences) were seeded with 5  103cells in 100L of medium with 0.1% FBS. Inserts precoated with Matrigel (40L, 1mg/mL; BD Biosciences) were used for invasion assays. Medium with 10% FBS (400L) was added to the lower chamber and served as a chemotactic agent. Noninvasive cells were wiped from the upper side of the membrane and cells on the lower side were fixed in cold methanol (20°C) and air dried. Cell were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (dissolved in methanol) and counted using the inverted microscope. Each individual experiment had triplicate inserts, and 4 microscopic fields were counted per insert.
The cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry (FCM). For cell cycle analysis, cells were plated at a density of 3  105 per well in 6-well plate and transfected with either PCMV-let-7g overexpression plasmid or a blank vector control. Cells were washed twice with cold Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and fixedin 70% cold ethanol O/N at 4°C. After incubation with RNase for 1h at 4°C, DNA was stained with 2L propidium iodide (PI) (400mg/mL) for 15min then was analyzed by FCM. For cell cycle analysis, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit was used (Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA), and AnnexinV-FITC staining was performed following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 400L with 1 binding buffer at a concentration of 1  106cells/mL. Cells were then mixed with 5L of the Annexin V-FITC solution and 2L of propidium iodide (PI). Cells were incubated for 15min at 4°C in the dark then analyzed by FCM.
To evaluate in vivo tumorigenesis, HCC xenografting mouse model was developed. Male BALB/c-nude mice of 4 weeks were prepared for tumor implantation. All animals were maintained in a sterile environment on a daily 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and categorized into 2 groups with each group being 8 nude mice. After resuspension in PBS, HCCLM3 cells (3  106/mouse) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of the nude mice. One week after implantation when the tumor became visually palpable at the size of 2mm in diameter, intratumoral injection with 40g of let-7g precursor plasmid dissolved in 100L of DMEM mixed with 5L of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was done every two days. Tumor volume (TV) was measured every two days according to the formula: TV (mm3) = length  width2  0.5.
Data were expressed as mean  SD and were analyzed by Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and Ï 2 test using SPSS for Windows version 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, USA). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and log rank test was done. The significance of various variables for survival was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model in a multivariate analysis. P < 0.05 in all cases was considered statistically significant.
