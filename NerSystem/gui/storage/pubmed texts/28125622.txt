As described, the FFAME Study (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01048502) recruited healthy volunteers (N = 60, 43% Female, 65% European ancestry [EA], 20% African ancestry [AA], 15% Asian ancestry) to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) for a placebo-controlled (corn oil (99.4%) with -tocopherol (0.6%) as an antioxidant). 68 week n-3 PUFA supplementation trial (EPA/DHA at 900mg/day or 3600mg/day) followed by an inpatient evoked endotoxemia protocol (0.6ng/kg LPS). Samples of gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained and snap-frozen for subsequent RNA extraction. A subset of EA subjects (n = 6 placebo, n = 8 n-3 PUFA 3600mg/day; 50% Female) were selected for adipose tissue RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of adipose biopsies obtained at baseline, after supplementation, and after LPS challenge (4hrs post-LPS). The trial was conducted with the approval of the UPenn Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent.
The GENE Study recruited healthy individuals (N = 294, 52% Female, 65% EA, 35% AA) ancestry to a University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) inpatient Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) protocol as previously described (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00953667). Participants completed an endotoxin challenge (1ng/kg E coli-derived LPS; U.S. standard reference, lot No. CCRE-LOT-1+2, Clinical Center, Pharmacy Department at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD). Multiple clinical variables were assessed during the visit. Individuals were ranked by their peak clinical inflammatory response ( from baseline for fever, plasma TNF, plasma IL-6). Individuals falling within the top and bottom 5% of responses were designated as high or low responders respectively. CD14+ monocytes were isolated from whole blood using magnetic bead selection (Dynabeads CD14, ThermoFisher, Waltham MA), and frozen in TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher, Waltham MA) for subsequent RNA extraction via standard protocol.. The GENE study was approved by UPenns Institutional Review Board (IRB), with regulatory oversight by the FDA (LPS: IND# 5984) and an NIH-appointed data-safety and monitoring board. All subjects provided written informed consent.
RNA from FFAME Study adipose tissue biopsies (3 samples per subject) was extracted using the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration and quality was assessed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Strand-specific poly-A RNA libraries (TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA) were prepared as described. Briefly, libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer, with 6 samples per lane (~30million 2101 bp paired-end reads per sample after filtering). RNASeq data were generated and analyzed for the GENE Study as described. For the in vitro experiments, RNA was subjected to RT-PCR and subsequent quantitative PCR (qPCR) using pre-designed primers and probes (Applied Biosystems 7900 Real-Time PCR System, Foster City, CA) for measurement of candidate gene mRNA (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12). Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and analyzed using the relative quantitation 2-(Ct) method to determine relative-change.
Blood samples were collected into EDTA tubes, mixed by inversion, and immediately placed on ice. Plasma was obtained through centrifugation, and immediately frozen and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis. Plasma S100A9 protein was measured in a subset of individuals from the GENE study before and after LPS (n = 16) using the SOMALogic SOMAscan assay. This assay panel measures 1129 proteins simultaneously using aptamer technology.
For in vitro experiments, pre-adipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were isolated, cultured and differentiated to adipocytes as previously described. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in OF medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and differentiated in serum-free medium with high insulin and PPAR agonist. Adipocytes were treated with EPA and DHA (50M in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 hours. THP-1 monocytes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were treated with EPA and DHA (100 M in DMSO) or vehicle (DMSO) for 72 hours. Treatment concentration and time for each cell type was determined based on previous time and dose response experiments (data not shown). Cells were then treated with LPS (100ng/ml) for 4 hours, and harvested for RNA extraction using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA).
As described, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected using Mononuclear Cell Preparation tubes (BD Vacutainer) and cultured for 7 days to induce macrophage differentiation. Macrophages were polarized using LPS and interferon- (M1) or IL-4 (M2). RNA was extracted (All Prep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNASeq libraries were prepared (TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit; Illumina, San Diego, CA), and sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000) as described. RNASeq data are available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession numbers GSE55536.
RNASeq data were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using STAR 2.3.0e with default options. RNA-SeqC was used to assess quality of each sample. Estimated gene expression levels from pre- to post-LPS were quantified as fragments per kilobase per million fragments mapped (FPKM), and analyzed using the cuffdiff option in Cufflinks version 2.1.1. Relative expression fold changes were calculated by dividing post-LPS by pre-LPS expression values. FFAME Study RNASeq data were deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), accession number GSE87426. GENE Study data are deposited under accession number GSE39118. Publicly available expression data (GSE5099 and GSE28070) were queried from datasets deposited in GEO and analyzed using GEO2R. In vitro and protein data were assessed for normality of distribution, and analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, 2-way ANOVA and by Spearman correlation. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and GraphPad Prism 6. All p values quoted for array-wide experiments (e.g. RNASeq, microarray, eQTL) are after adjustment for platform-specific multiple testing.
