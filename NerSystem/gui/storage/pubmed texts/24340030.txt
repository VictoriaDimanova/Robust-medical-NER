Neutralization antibodies against IL-10, MCP-1, control immunoglobulin G (IgG), and recombinant human M-CSF and RANKL were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Western blot antibodies against phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated NF-B, ERK, JNK, p38MAPK and STAT3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against RANK were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA).
MM cell lines ARP-1 and ARK were kindly provided by the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, Little Rock, AR. Other cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Primary MM cells were isolated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from bone marrow aspirates of MM patients during routine clinic visits by using anti-CD138 monoclonal antibody-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Auburn, CA). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. All human participants provided written informed consent. All MM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech Cellgro, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics.
The method for generating OCs in vitro has been described previously. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donor buffy coats (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, TX) by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, WI) density gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were isolated from the PBMCs by using anti-CD14 antibody-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Auburn, CA) and cultured in -MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, and 25 ng/mL of human M-CSF for 7 days to obtain TRAP+ mononuclear cells (as preOCs). PreOCs were then cultured in medium with M-CSF (25 ng/mL) and RANKL (50 ng/mL) for another 7 days to obtain multinuclear (>3 nuclei) TRAP+ mature OCs. The numbers of multinuclear TRAP+ OCs per well of 24-well plate were counted. 
In cocultures, CD14+ monocytes (5  105/mL) were seeded in culture wells, and MM cells (2  105/mL) were coseeded in culture wells or separately seeded in transwell inserts. In some cocultures, BMSCs (5  105/mL) were also coseeded with MM cells in transwell inserts. Cells were cultured in M-CSF-containing medium with or without RANKL for 14 days. BMSCs were generated from the bone marrow aspirates of MM patients or healthy donors or were generated from human healthy fetal bones in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. 
TRAP staining for detection of mature OCs was performed with the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) according to the manufacturers instructions. Quantitative measurement of active isoform TRAP 5b was done using BoneTRAP Assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Inc., Scottsdale, AZ) according to the manufacturers instructions.
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, MD). An aliquot of 1 g of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with SuperScript II RT PCR kit (Invitrogen, CA). 1 L of the final cDNA was applied to real-time PCR amplification with SYBR Green using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Invitrogen, ABI, CA) and the following primers: 
 CTSK: CCATATGTGGGACAGGAAGA, CCTCTTCAGGGCTTTCTCAT;
 TRAP: AGATCCTGGGTGCAGACTTC, AAGGGAGCGGTCAGAGAATA; 
 CALCA: TGGTGCAGAACTATGTGCAG, CTTGTTGAAGTCCTGCGTGT; 
 CALCR: GGGAATCCAGTTTGTCGTCT, ACAAAGAAGCCCTGGAAATG; 
 IL-8: TCCTGATTTCTGCAGCTCTG, GTCCACTCTCAATCACTCTCAG; 
 IL-10: AGGATCAGCTGGACAACTTG, GATGTCTGGGTCTTGGTTCTC; 
 MCP-1: CAGCCAGATGCAATCAATGCC, TGGAATCCTGAACCCACTTCT;

 TPO: CCTTCCAAGTCGGCAAATTC, ACAAAGTCCCCATTCTCCAC; 
 RANK: GAAGAAGAAGCCAGCAGGAC, CCAGTCACATTTCCAGATGC; 
 GAPDH: CTGGGCTACACTGAGCACC, AAGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAATG.
Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, MA). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated NF-B, p38, ERK, JNK, and Akt. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti--actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) to ensure equal protein loading. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used for detection, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology, IL) and autoradiography. 
Cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated RANK antibody (eBioscience, CA) after Fc blocking and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. 
The supernatants (as conditioned medium) were collected from cultures of MM cells alone or BMSCs alone or cocultures of MM cells and BMSCs together in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 hours. The array (Raybio Human Cytokine Array 3 kit; RayBiotech, GA) was incubated with conditioned medium. Protein spots were detected and quantified by autoradiography according to the manufacturers instructions. The value of the scans was adjusted on the basis of the intensity of positive control spots on each membrane by using MultiGauge V3.0 software (Fujifilm, Japan).
In addition, cytokine levels in conditioned medium were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Bethyl Laboratories, TX) according to the manufacturers instructions. 
Experimental values are expressed as means  standard errors of the means unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance was analyzed with SPSS 10.0 software using unpaired Students t-tests and one-way analysis of variance. A P value  0.05 was considered statistically significant. All results were reproduced in at least three independent experiments.
