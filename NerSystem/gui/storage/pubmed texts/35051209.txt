A 14-day randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind Phase 1 trial of PC-6500, sponsored by the Population Council (New York, NY), was conducted at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) in the Bronx, NY. The main (randomized) period of the trial was preceded by a single-dose, open label (OL) period among a different group of participants. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Population Council and Einstein prior to initiation of data collection. The protocol was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration as IND # 123512 and registered at Clinical Trials.gov., number NCT02875119. All participants provided written informed consent before undergoing any procedures. Participants and staff at the Council and Einstein were blinded to the product assignment for the randomized portion of the study, but not time point, through the end of data collection.
Healthy, HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 1849 who were using an effective contraceptive method other than condoms or a vaginal ring, and who agreed to remain sexually abstinent during the study were invited to participate. Potential participants were assigned a unique identification number and screened for eligibility based on medical history, physical examination, pelvic examination, Pap smear if indicated, blood (CBC and chemistry) and STI testing, including HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas. Women with a laboratory abnormality, STI or abnormal Pap test were ineligible. Women with symptomatic BV, vulvovaginal candidiasis, or urinary tract infection at screening could be rescreened following completion of treatment.
All participants (n = 7) in the OL period were to receive one single 4 g dose of PC-6500 administered vaginally by a study clinician.
In the randomized period, 20 participants were instructed to self-administer 14 doses of PC-6500 or its matching CG placebo (PC-535) once daily for 14 days; OL participants were not eligible for the randomized period to prevent participants using both PC-6500 and placebo, which could confound data interpretation. Day 1/Dose 1 was scheduled as soon as possible after menstruation ended to maximize the likelihood that all 14 days of dosing would occur during the non-bleeding days of the menstrual cycle. Participants administered five of the 14 doses in the clinic with a study staff member in the room, but with a curtain drawn for privacy. The other nine doses were to be self-administered at home at approximately the same time each day. Both gels (Table 1) were manufactured and packaged in identical individually wrapped, prefilled, single-use, metered dose applicators (HTI Plastics; Lincoln, NE) at the Population Councils Good Manufacturing Practices facility (Center for Biomedical Research, New York, NY). PC-6500 was manufactured using recombinant plant-produced GRFT. The two study gels (PC-6500 and PC-535) differed imperceptibly in appearance; both were translucent with a faint beige color.
A Population Council statistician not associated with the trial created the randomization scheme that pre-assigned participants to either PC-6500 or placebo gel in a ratio of 7:3. Half of the participants were assigned blood and cervicovaginal lavage (CVLs) sample collection at 4h post dose; half were assigned to the 8h time point. Having different two time points for CVL collection allowed us to explore the length of time product remains present and active in the vagina. Randomization occurred in blocks of ten. Study staff received a list of kit numbers and specimen time point randomization assignments for 20 participants. All investigators, study staff and participants were blinded to product assignments. The post-dose specimen time points (4h, 8h and 24h) were not blinded. Due to inclement weather, specimen collection for one participant in the PC-6500 group was done at 6h instead of 8h post first dose.
Due to slower than anticipated accrual, it was not feasible to enroll all 20 women within the time and budget available. Therefore, the protocol was amended so that starting with the tenth enrollee, participants were assigned a kit number and time point, on a case-by-case basis, to maximize the number of women assigned to product vs. placebo, and to maintain the balance in post-dose specimen collection time points.
The schedule of visits and procedures performed in the OL and randomized periods of the study are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Outcome measures and analytical methods are described in detail below. The schedule was designed to collect BL samples and 24h post last gel samples (randomized phase) in late luteal phase to minimize effects of the menstrual cycle on exploratory outcomes.
Safety was evaluated at each study visit (Tables 2 and 3). Safety endpoints included treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and medical significance, in the investigators judgment, of abnormalities in physical exams, pelvic exams, cervical and vaginal biopsies, and clinical laboratory parameters once product had been administered. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 21.0), and graded according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0 and the Female Genital Table for Use in Microbicide Studies.
Safety data were summarized by treatment group (OL, randomized PC-6500, placebo). Exposure was calculated by participant based on the number of applicators inserted vaginally, as measured by dye stain assay (DSA) test (sensitivity 93%, specificity 100%).
Swabs and CVLs were tested for presence of semenogelin using the RSID test (Independent Forensics, Lombard, IL).
The histopathological assessment was performed by board-certified gynecologic pathologist using inflammation scoring as detailed in S1 Table.
Concentrations of GRFT in plasma and in CVLs collected using 10 ml of sterile normal saline were measured by a validated indirect sandwich ELISA. 96-well Immulon 2HB microplates (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were pre-coated with HIV-1BaL gp-120 (NIH Reagent Program Cat#49610, Germantown, MD). After blocking, the samples were added to the plate in duplicate. A goat anti-GRFT detection antibody (Pacific Immunology, Ramona, CA) was added and the mixture, followed by a rabbit anti-goat-HRP secondary antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Ultra-TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific) was added followed by sulfuric acid (Thermo Scientific). Plates were washed and read on the Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 450 nm (570 nm for reference) using the SoftMax Pro GxP 5.4.6 software (Molecular Devices). The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) were 10 ng/mL and 1.25 ng/mL for plasma and CVL, respectively.
Interleukin (IL)-1 (lower limit of detection (LLD) 0.3pg/mL), IL1 RA (LLD 13.1 pg/mL), IL-6 (LLD 0.5 pg/mL), CCL5 (LLD 0.19 pg/mL), CXCL8 (LLD 0.4 pg/mL), CCL20 (LLD 70.4 pg/mL) were measured using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), Gaithersburg, MD). Each ECL immunoassay was optimized to allow detection of each biomarker within the linearity concentration range in the clarified CVL samples. IL1RA was tested in duplicates at 50- and 100-fold dilutions and when values exceeded the precision range of the assay, at an additional 1000-fold dilution. Other mediators were tested at a 2-fold or a 4-fold dilution, and where applicable undiluted, to generate duplicate values within linearity. The serial dilution of CVL samples resulted in reproducible values within the linearity range of each assay proving by accepted immunoassay methodology no matrix interference due to potential presence of study gel or other CVL matrix components. In addition, to rule out interference with the presence of gels, serial dilutions of a CG-containing gel were prepared in saline and mixed with equal volumes of biomarker solutions of known concentrations. Full CC/CK recovery was achieved in the concentration range of CG detected in CVL.
Total RNA was isolated from ectocervical biopsy tissues taken from participants in the randomized study at BL pre-dose and post-dose 14 (one biopsy at each time point) and frozen in RNAlater (Ambion) following the manufacturers instructions (RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD)). The quality and purity of the extracted RNA were measured by the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). RNA was labeled, sequenced at the Rockefeller University (RU) Genomics Center by using Illumina TruSeq technology (75bp, >30M coverage) and analyzed as we previously published. A multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) plot showing expression of top 500 genes in two dimensions was prepared within edgeR (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616). To visualize gene expression patterns before and after gel treatment, a heatmap was plotted on the log transformation of count per million (logCPM) through R heatmap package (Kolde R, Package pheatmap for R. Version 1.0.8 (2015). Specifically, the top 500 variant genes (based on p adj. value) were selected to represent the heatmap. The volcano plots of gene expression according to the fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values were prepared through in-house R code.
ELISA plates were coated with 20 g/mL of GRFT. Following blocking and washes, serum samples and NM479 standards were added to the plate. For the samples, collected human serum was diluted 1:50. For the standard curve, 2X concentrated NM479 (1000 ng/mL 0.98 ng/mL) was diluted 1:1 in 25X diluted serum (Innovative Research), for a final serum dilution of 50X and final NM479 concentrations ranging from 500 ng/mL to 0.49 ng/mL. Then biotinylated KQ-GRFT was added to the plates. KQ-GRFT is a modified version of Q-GRFT that contains a lysine at the N-terminus of the protein. Then plates were washed followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated with streptavidin (SA-HRP) (Pierce). ADAs were detected using TMB (SeraCare), and the reaction was stopped with addition of sulfuric acid. OD 450 nm was measured on a Biotek Synergy HT plate reader.
The multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay in TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) was modified for evaluation of activity of GRFT in CVLs. Briefly, TMZ-bl cells cultured in 96-well white-opaque flat bottom microplates (Thermo Scientific) received different dilutions of non-clarified CVLs. GRFT solutions (between 100 and 0.015 ng/mL) prepared by diluting CMB-BDS-0900-003 GRFT stock (17 mg/mL) with cell culture medium were used as a control in the antiviral assay. All wells (including virus controls but excluding cell controls) were immediately challenged with 100200 HIV-1ADA-M infectious particles and stained using the MAGI assay following incubation. All CVL dilutions and controls were tested in triplicate.
The anti-HPV activity of selected CVL samples was tested in HeLa cells using the luciferase assay. Briefly, HeLa cells cultured overnight at 105 cells/mL in 96-well clear flat bottom microplates (Thermo Scientific) were incubated with different dilutions of non-clarified CVLs in triplicate. A 3% carrageenan gel (Population Council, lot#160613B6500 placebo TZ) diluted to between 1000 and 0.15 ng/mL with cell culture medium was used as a control in the antiviral assay. All wells (including virus controls but excluding cell controls) were immediately challenged with HPV16 PsV (5x105 copies per well) and stained using the Pierce Firefly Luciferase Glow Assay (Thermo Scientific) following incubation. All CVL dilutions and controls were tested in triplicate.
Ectocervical explants (5x5mm) were prepared as we previously described, stimulated with PHA (5 g/mL) and IL-2 (100 U/mL) and then challenged with 500 TCID50 HIV-1BaL/explant (in duplicate) in the presence of non-clarified CVLs. HIV-1BaL was generated and titered as previously described. Ten L of viral stock diluted in CVL (500 TCID50 of HIVBaL; 1.79l of virus and 8.21l of CVL) was applied on the top of the epithelium for 2h at 37°C in 5% CO2 followed by a wash out. Tissues were then cultured in complete DMEM for 14 days (d). Where feasible, untreated control (culture medium) was included. Also, to discriminate between the viral inoculum and de novo viral replication lamivudine (3TC: 4L of 500M stock applied on the epithelium) control was included. Tissue culture supernatants were collected right after washes (d0) and during culture (d3, 7, 11, 14). Infection was monitored with validated HIV gag reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) with LLOQ 20,000 copies/mL. Any value below LLOQ was set to 200001/2 = 1099.74. Endpoint soft (SOFT; maximal viral growth) and cumulative (CUM) (d3 to 14) analyses were performed.
We explored if exposure to PC-6500 induces tissue toxicity, which may interfere with testing of anti-HIVBaL activity of CVLs. Effects of PC-6500 on epithelial integrity and ectocervical tissue viability were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and the MTT assay [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay, respectively. Human ectocervical tissues without gross pathological changes were obtained from routine hysterectomies through the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI; Philadelphia, P) and transported overnight (ON) in RPMI medium. 5x5mm and 3x3mm explants were prepared as we previously described for macaque and human cervicovaginal tissues. Undiluted gels, PC-6500 (batches 131004B6500TR and 141027A6500TZ) and PC-535 (batch 130918A525TR), were applied on the epithelial surface of 5x5m explants and left ON (polarized cultures). Alternatively, 3x3mm explants were immersed in 1:30 and 1:100 diluted gels ON. Following incubation, tissues were processed for H&E staining (polarized cultures) or the MTT assay (immersion cultures).
As is typical for first-in-human studies, no formal sample size calculation was carried out for this study. A sample size of seven participants in the single dose OL portion of the study, and 20 participants in the randomized portion (14 active; 6 placebo) was deemed sufficient to evaluate the safety of PC-6500 and to assess the PK of GRFT. Number and percent of participants with TEAEs are summarized by treatment arm and relationship and toxicity. Descriptive statistics are presented by treatment arm for demographic and baseline characteristics and for clinical endpoints. Analysis was done with SAS Version 9.4.
Log-normal generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze changes in CC/CK concentrations in CVL adjusting for treatment type. Treatment (PC-6500 or placebo) was a fixed effect in the model and a random effect for each participant was included. Values below LLD were assumed LLD/10. Pairwise differences were calculated using Tukey-adjusted 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
For transcriptome analysis, edgeR* v 3.16.5 was used to normalize the samples and Voom from limma# v 3.30.11 was applied to estimate the differential log fold change in the expression of genes. An FDR adjusted p value <0.05 was used to determine if there was a change in cervical gene expression post gel application.
For analysis of anti-HIV-1ADA-M activity of CVLs in TZM-bl MAGI assay, the EC50 and 95% CIs were calculated using a curve-fitting analysis (GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). GRFT concentrations and anti-HIV activity in CVLs were correlated using the Spearman correlation analysis (GraphPad Prism). Similarly, for analysis of anti-HPV activity in CVLs, the EC50 and 95% CIs were calculated using a curve-fitting analysis (GraphPad Prism).
For analysis of anti-HIV-1BaL activity of CVLs in ectocervical explants, log-normal generalized linear mixed models were used. The models examined the relationship between SOFT and CUM as the independent variables and treatment type, CVL collection time and their interaction as the dependent variables (fixed effects). A random intercept for each participant was included. Pairwise comparisons were calculated and stepdown simulation-adjusted 95% CIs reported. GRFT concentrations and anti-HIV activity in CVLs were correlated using the Spearman correlation analysis (GraphPad Prism).
For analysis of tissue viability after exposure to gels in vitro, log-normal generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts were used. Optical density (OD) 570/tissue weight (g) was the response variable. Predictors were gel treatments. Tissue donor was included as a random effect (SAS).
