A total of 131 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, including 80 liposarcomas from 65 patients, 19 lipomas from 17 patients, 15 hyperplasia of adipose tissues from 10 patients, 8 panniculitis from 8 patients, and 9 normal adipose tissues from 9 patients, were acquired from the affiliated Southeast Hospital of Xiamen University between January 2010 and June 2013, with complete clinicopathologic parameters. Confirmed healthy human brain obtained from biopsy and skeletal muscle from patients who underwent orthopedic surgery were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. All the specimens were obtained after obtaining written informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the affiliated Southeast Hospital of Xiamen University.
Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two micrograms of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription. Sequences of forward and reverse primers, amplified fragment sizes, and annealing temperatures were as follows: Eag1, 5-GCT TTT GAG AAC GTG GAT GAG-3, 5-CGA AGA TGG TGG CAT AGA GAA-3, 475bp, 56°C. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5-GCC TCA AGA TCA GCA AT-3, 5-AGG TCC ACC ACT GAC ACG TT-3, 310bp, 56°C. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7,000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) and the results were analyzed by the relative standard curve method (User Bulletin #2 of ABI Prism 7,700 Sequence Detection Systems, Applied Biosystems).
The tissue slide was baked in a dry oven at 60°C for 2h to remove the coated paraffin. The samples were demineralized with an equal parts mixture of 20% sodium citrate and 45% formic acid. The slide was immersed twice in xylene for 3min, hydrated with 100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol, and rinsed with cold tap water for 5min. After dewaxing and blocking endogenous peroxidases, the sections were treated at 100°C in EDTA (1mM, pH 8.0) for antigen retrieval and then incubated with Eag1 polyclonal antibody (ab86204, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, 1:300) overnight at 4°C. The slides were washed with PBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature for 1h. Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Zhongshan Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was used to visualize the tissue slide and the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Samples were defined as positive when more than 10% of the cells stained positive with Eag1 antibody. Eag1 staining was classified as 0 (less than 10% of the tumor cells show staining), 1+ (faint staining in more than 10% of the cells), 2+ (moderate staining in more than 10% tumor cells), and 3+ (strong staining in more than 10% of the cells) and the immunohistochemical score was evaluated as negative (0), positive (1), and strongly positive (2 and 3) as described previously.
Human liposarcoma cell line SW-872 (HTB-92), 93T449 (CRL-3043), and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). SW-872 cells were cultured in MEM (minimum essential medium) media (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100IU/mL penicillin, and 100g/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. 93T449 and HEK293 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100g/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. All cells were subcultured every 3-4 days. Imipramine was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in distilled water as 1mM stock solution and stored at 20°C.
The oligonucleotides targeting human Eag1 were designed and selected as the template: AGC CAT CTT GGT CCC TTA TAA, which shared no homology with other coding sequences in human by BLAST analysis. A ring sequence of 9 base pairs (TTC AAG ACG) existed between the sense and antisense strands. The shRNA was synthesised by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Plasmid pGeneSil-1 was purchased from GeneSil Biotechnology (Wuhan, China), which contained the human U6 promoter inserted between BamHI and HindIII sites. The shRNA cassette was subcloned into pAdTrack vector between HindIII and XbaI sites. The recombinant plasmid was linearized by digestion with restriction endonuclease and subsequently cotransformed into E. coli BJ5183 cells with an adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Recombinant plasmids were selected for kanamycin resistance and transfected into HEK293 cells. A recombinant adenovirus expressing shRNA against Eag (Ad5-Eag1-shRNA) was generated. The recombinant adenovirus control (Ad5-Control-shRNA), which carried a sequence of CTA GGT GTT CTA GTC TGG ACT and did not target any known human genes, was generated as control. All viruses were propagated and purified on a CsCl gradient using standard methods. Functional titer (plaque forming units) was determined with a plaque assay on HEK293 cells according to the method developed by Quantum Biotechnology.
Human liposarcoma cells (1  105) in serum-free media were infected with Ad5-Eag1-shRNA or Ad5-Control-shRNA at 5 MOI (multiplicity of infection, calculated as PFU/cell numbers) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Virus containing medium was removed 8h later and replaced with fresh MEM medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were incubated for another 48h.
Cell proliferation was analyzed by using Cell Counting Assay Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5  103 cells were starved in serum-free medium for 12h and then the cells were infected with vectors or exposed to 20M imipramine. After 96h, the cells were harvested. Ten microliters of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, the cells were incubated for 1h, and the absorbance (A) at 490nm was measured by using spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Experiments were performed at least three times with representative data presented.
For colony formation assay, cells were seeded at 300 per 60 mm dish in triplicate and cultured to 2 weeks. The assay was stopped when the colonies are clearly visible even without looking under the microscope. Cell colonies were fixed and stained with 0.25% crystal violet in 50% ethanol for 20 to 30min and then air dried and counted. The colony formation ratio was calculated according to the following formula: colony formation ratio (%) = (colony number/seeded cell number)  100%.
Thymus-null BALB/c nude mice (female, 46 weeks old) were obtained from the Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All animal procedures were performed according to approved protocols and in accordance with recommendations for the proper use and care of laboratory animals. Liposarcoma xenografts were established in nude mice as described previously. The liposarcoma-bearing mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 6). Group 1 received intratumor injection with Ad5-Eag1-shRNA (10 MOI) every 3 days (6 injections totally). Group 2 received intratumor injections of Ad5-Control-shRNA (10 MOI) every 3 days (6 injections totally). Group 3 received normal saline injection as controls. Tumor growth was measured using caliper, and tumor volume (mm3) was determined with formula ab 2/2, where a was the length and b was the width of the tumor.
The cells were collected and washed twice with cold PBS following the infection with shRNA for 48h, and then cell pellets were resuspended at 1  106 cells/mL and fixed in 70% cold ethanol overnight at 4°C. A fluorochrome solution containing 50g/mL PI, 3.4mmol/L sodium citrate, 20g/mL RNase A, and 1% Triton X-100 was added and the mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30min. The distribution of the cell cycle was measured using flow cytometry (FCM; Partec, Mnster, Germany). FCM analysis was performed using the Cell Quest software (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
5-6  107 cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150mmol/L NaCl, 0.2mmol/L EDTA, 1mmol/L PMSF, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40 for 30min. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,200rpm for 10min at 4°C and the supernatants were collected. 25g proteins were resolved by a 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) nonfat milk powder at room temperature for 1h and then incubated with antibodies against Eag1 (Abcam), p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) for 1h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were developed with chemiluminescent detection kit (Zhongshan Biotechnology). Experiments were performed at least three times with representative data presented.
All data were presented as mean  standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Ï 2-test using the SPSS18.0 program. P < 0.05 was considered as significant difference.
