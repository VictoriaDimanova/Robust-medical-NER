Diagnostic bone marrow samples (n=9, Table S1) from children with de novo AML were obtained from the Childrens Hospital of Michigan leukemia cell bank. Mononuclear cells were purified by standard Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. Written informed consent was provided by the parent or legal guardian according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Sample handling and data analysis protocols were approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Wayne State University School of Medicine.
Cytarabine and DNR were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Panobinostat was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Clinically, panobinostat steady-state plasma concentrations range from 15 to 22 nM over 48 h (data from Novartis Investigators Brochure).
THP-1 and U937 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The OCI-AML3 cell line was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). The CTS cell line was a gift from Dr. A Fuse from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (or MEM for OCI-AML3 cells) media with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 2 mM L-glutamine, plus 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
Diagnostic blast samples were cultured in RPMI 1640/20% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with ITS solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20% supernatant of the 5637 bladder cancer cell line (as a source of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). The cells were plated at a density of 1106 cells/mL and cultured in the presence of 040 nM panobinostat for 48 h in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
AML cell lines were treated with panobinostat and cytarabine or DNR for 48 h and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to determine drug-induced apoptosis using the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Kit (Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA), as previously described. Results were expressed as percent of Annexin V+ cells. Synergy was quantified using the cooperativity index (cooperativity index=sum of apoptosis of single-agent treatment/apoptosis on combined treatment). Cooperativity index <1, 1, or >1 is termed synergistic, additive, or antagonistic, respectively. Experiments were performed 3 independent times in triplicate. Data presented are from one representative experiment.
Cell cycle analysis was done as previously described. Briefly, AML Cells were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 80% (v/v) ethanol for 24 h. After centrifugation at 200g for 5 min, the cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS containing PI (50 mg/mL), triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), and DNase-free RNase (1 mg/mL). The DNA contents were determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data analysis was done with the Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). Experiments were performed 3 independent times in triplicate. Data presented are from one representative experiment.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies) and cDNAs were prepared from 1 µg total RNA using random hexamer primers and a RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies), and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as previously described. BRCA1 (Hs00173237_m1), CHK1 (Hx00967506_m1), RAD51 (Hs00153418_m1) and E2F1 (Hs00153451_m1) transcripts were quantitated using Taqman probes (Life Technologies) and a LightCycler real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), based on the manufacturers instructions. Real-time PCR results were expressed as means from 3 independent experiments and were normalized to GAPDH (4333764) or RPL13a (Hs03043885_g1) transcripts. Fold changes were calculated using the comparative Ct method.
Cells were lysed in Tris buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Thermo Fisher Inc., Rockford, IL) and immunoblotted with anti-acetyl-histone 4 (ac-H4, 06598), -H4 (07108) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), -BRCA1 (9010), -H2AX (2577), -RPL13a (2765), -Caspase 3 (9661), -PARP (9542), -p-CDC25C (9528), -E2F1 (3742) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), -RAD51 (sc-8349), -CHK1 (sc-8408, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) -acetyl-tubulin (T7451) or --actin (A2228, Sigma-Aldrich) antibody, as described previously. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), as described by the manufacturer. Western blots were repeated at least 3 times and one representative blot is shown.
 In vitro cytotoxicities of AML diagnostic blasts were measured by using MTT (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide, Sigma-Aldrich) assays, as previously described. Briefly, the cells were cultured as mentioned in Panobinostat Treatment of Diagnostic Blast Samples and treated with variable concentrations of panobinostat (0160 nM) for 48 hours. IC50 values were calculated as drug concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% proliferation compared to untreated control cells. IC50 values are means of duplicates from one experiment.
The pMD-VSV-G and delta 8.2 plasmids were gifts from Dr. Dong at the Tulane University. The transfection was carried out by using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, a lentivirus vector (BRCA1, CHK1, or RAD51 shRNA construct from Sigma-Aldrich or CHK1 cDNA construct from Thermo Fisher Scientific Biosciences, Lafayette, CO), pMD-VSV-G and delta 8.2 were cotransfected into TLA-HEK293T cells and the culture medium was harvested 48 h post-transfection. One million THP-1 Cells were transduced by adding 1 ml of virus supernatant and 4 µg of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich).
THP-1 cells, infected with NTC-, BRCA1-, CHK1- or RAD51-shRNA, were treated with 50 µM cytarabine for 3 h. The cells were washed and cultured for up to 8 h. The harvested cells were mixed with 1.0% low melting point agarose in PBS (Mg and Ca free) at 37oC. Approximately 5000 cells were layered onto pre-coated microscope slides (pre-coated slides were coated with a thin layer of 1% low melting point agarose and allowed to dry for 90 min), a glass coverslip was placed on top of the cell/agarose suspension and the gels were allowed to gel for 10 min at 4°C. The slides were then placed in lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 10% DMSO and 1% Triton X-100, pH 10.0) overnight at 4°C. The slides were placed in electrophoresis buffer (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH 13.0) for 40 min at 4°C to allow unwinding of the DNA. Electrophoresis was conducted for 30 min at 30 V (1.25 V/cm). After electrophoresis, the slides were rinsed in 400 mL distilled water, dipped in 95% ethanol and dried. DNA was stained with 130,000 SYBR Gold (Life Techonologies) in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 plus 1 mM EDTA for 40 min at room temperature. The slides were rinsed in distilled water and imaged on an Olympus BX-40 microscope with an Olympus DP72 microscope camera and Olympus cellSens Dimension software (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). 50 comets per gel were scored using CometScore (TriTek Corp, Sumerduck, VA). The median percent DNA in the tail from at least three replicate gels were averaged and graphed. The error bars indicate standard errors of the means.
U937 cells were transfected with a murine stem cell virus-green fluorescent protein vector containing the firefly Luciferase gene (pMSCV-luc-IRES-GFP), sorted by flow cytometry, expanded in culture and 10,000 cells were injected intravenously into the tail vein of 8- to 12-week-old female NOD-SCID-IL2Rnull (NSG) mice (n=36), as described previously.
To evaluate antileukemic activity, groups of 810 tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to receive panobinostat [5 mg/kg once daily for 3 weeks, provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland)], cytarabine (6.25 mg/kg once daily for 4 weeks), or combination (panobinostat 5 mg/kg once daily for 3 weeks plus ara-C 6.25 mg/kg once daily for 4 weeks) starting on day 3 after injection of U937 cells. A group of vehicle treated mice were included as controls with each experiment. For intraperitoneal injection panobinostat was formulated in 5% dextrose and cytarabine was formulated in PBS.
Noninvasive imaging was performed twice weekly in all experiments to monitor tumor engraftment, as previously described. The Luciferase substrate D-luciferin firefly potassium salt (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA) at a dose of 150 mg/kg was administered by intraperitoneal injection. The mice were then anesthetized by 1.5%2.5% isoflurane inhalation, and bioluminescence was done 5 minutes later using a Xenogen in vivo imaging system (Hopkinton, MA) in the Animal Imaging Facility at St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Total bioluminescence was quantified for the body area that included each mouse in its entirety. Mice were monitored daily and were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation when they showed signs of terminal illness, including hind limb paralysis, inability to eat or drink, and/or moribund. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies were performed to determine in vivo effects of panobinostat treatment on BRCA1, CHK1 and RAD51. When bioluminescence reached 1.5107 p/s/cm2/sr, day 17 after injection of U937 cells, mice received panobinostat (5 mg/kg once daily2). Four hours after the second dose mice were sacrificed, bone marrow was harvested, and snap frozen pellets were stored at 80°C. The percentage of leukemic cell infiltration in bone marrow was determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining.
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously. THP-1 cells were treated with or without 10 nM panobinostat for 48 h. Anti-E2F1 antibody (sc-193x) or normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for the immunoprecipitation. Real-time PCR for the E2F1 binding regions in the BRCA1, CHK1, or RAD51 promoter was performed using the primers listed in Table S2.
Differences in cell apoptosis and differences in transcript levels between cytarabine/DNR and panobinostat treated (individually or combined) and untreated cells were compared using the pair-wise two-sample t-test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival probability. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software. Error bars on all bar graphs represent standard errors of the means.
