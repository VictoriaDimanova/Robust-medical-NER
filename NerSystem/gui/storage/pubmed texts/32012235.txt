The LISA study was designed to investigate the influence of lifestyle and environmental factors on the immune system and the allergy risk in childhood as well as on the development of metabolic diseases. A total of 3097 newborns who were born between December 1997 and January 1999 in the four German cities of Munich, Leipzig, Wesel and Bad Honnef were engaged for this prospective birth cohort study. Only healthy term neonates of German descent were included. Newborn children whose mothers suffered from autoimmune disease or infectious disorders during pregnancy were excluded. The study design has been described in detail previously 34. Children were followedup regularly from birth to 15 years of age with clinical examinations and blood sampling. At the age of 15, blood samples were taken for the determination of several parameters and, in the subcohort from Leipzig, also for the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The present investigation is based on data gained from PBMC and is therefore restricted to the subcohort of Leipzig. All analyses were performed on overweight children (n = 41) and a randomly selected normal weight control group of these children (n = 41). Participation in the study was voluntary and informed written consent was given by the parents of all children. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the University of Leipzig (EKBR02/131).
Blood of study participants was obtained by venipuncture and prepared within 4 h for further analysis. In brief, heparinized blood samples were centrifuged (500 g, 10 min) and the cellfree supernatant (plasma) was collected and stored at 80°C until analysis. The remaining cell pellet was diluted 1 : 1 with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS); PBMC were isolated by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and cryopreserved until analysis. Serum was collected after clotting of whole blood and centrifugation at 2010 g for 10 min and 4°C. For the invitro bile acid assays, PBMC were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors (n = 6) using Ficoll Paque Plus and cryopreserved until analysis.
PBMC from the LISA study samples and from healthy donors were thawed and counted; 4  105 PBMC were directly used for surface staining and 1  106 living PBMC were seeded per well in 100 µl culture medium within a 96well Ubottomed (Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany) cellculture microplate. Culture medium composed of Iscoves modified Dulbeccos medium (IMDM) (GlutaMax supplement; Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BSA; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 1 penicillinstreptomycin solution (Biowest, Nuaill©, France) and 50 µM mercaptoethanol (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were allowed to rest overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with 30 bacteria per cell (BpC) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) for 6 h. After 2 h of E. coli stimulation, 10 µg/ml brefeldin A (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or in particular cases 2·5 µM monensin A and phycoerythrin (PE) antihuman CD107a [lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)] antibody (clone H4A3; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) were added. For intracellular staining, cells were treated with 1 BD FACSTM lysing Solution and 1 BD FACSTM permeabilizing solution 2. For the invitro bile acid assays, PBMC from healthy donors (n = 6) were pretreated with solvent [dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; final concentration 0·95%] or various concentrations (50, 100, 200 µM) of the bile acids taurolithocholic acid (sodium salt), tauroursodeoxycholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (sodium salt) (all from Cayman Chemical, Michigan, MI, USA) for 45 min prior to bacterial stimulation. The synthetic bile acid receptor agonists INT747 (Biomol GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and INT777 (Cayman) were used at the same concentrations to activate the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G proteincoupled bile acid receptor (TGR5), respectively, directly.
After invitro stimulation and fixation, PBMC were transferred to Vbottomed plates and stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluorTM 506 (eBioscience, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for dead cell exclusion, followed by cell surface and intracellular staining with the antibodies given in Supporting information, Table S4. The samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto¢ II cytometer provided with FACS Diva software version 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Data were evaluated with FlowJo version 10.2 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA) and Flowlogic Software (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
In order to obtain a starter culture of E. coli, 10 ml of LB Miller (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) pH 7.5 were inoculated with cryoconserved E. coli DH5 stock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) under sterile conditions and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C and 175 rpm. Thereafter, the starter culture was diluted 1 : 50 in fresh LB Miller to obtain the main culture, which was incubated for an additional 16 h in the incubation shaker at 37°C and 175 rpm. After centrifugation for 20 min at 2000 g and room temperature, the supernatant was discarded and the bacteria pellet was fixed using 1% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. The bacteria were then washed with PBS followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 2000 g and room temperature. Bacteria were counted using a Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and frozen as aliquots of 3  108 bacteria at 80°C.
In order to determine the impact of the bile acids TLCA, TUDCA and GCDCA on cell viability, the cell counting kit8 (CCK8; SigmaAldrich) was used. Specifically, 2  105 PBMC per well were seeded in 100 µl culture medium in a 96well Ubottomed plate. Cells were stimulated as described above; 2 h before the end of the stimulation, CCK8 reagent was added in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. The absorbance was then measured by means of a microplate reader (Tecan, Mnnedorf, Switzerland) at 450 nm (detection wavelength) and 650 nm (reference wavelength).
Highsensitivity (hs)CRP concentrations were measured in the serum samples of the study participants by means of the Roche (Mannheim, Germany) Tinaquant CRP (latex) highsensitivity assay, according to the manufacturers instructions.
The concentrations of total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL), highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were also measured in serum by means of homogenous enzymatic colorimetric methods on a Modular Analytics System from Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim, according to the manufacturers instructions. External controls were used in accordance with the guidelines of the German Society of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine.
Concentrations of the cytokines IL8 and MIP1 were measured in the plasma samples of study participants by means of flow cytometry using the BD CBA Human Soluble Flex Set system (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), according to the manufacturers instructions. In brief, cytokinespecific antibodycoated beads were incubated with 25 µl of plasma samples or standard solution for 1 h. Thereafter, samples were incubated with the corresponding PElabeled detection antibodies for 2 h. After one washing step, samples were measured using flow cytometry. Analysis of data and quantification of cytokines was performed with FCAP ArrayTM software (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) on the basis of corresponding standard curves.
The expression of the genes promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) and MR1 was measured via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the LISA study samples as well as in the invitro bile acid assay samples. Total RNA was prepared from blood collected in PAXgene blood RNA tube by PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After cDNA synthesis, gene expression was measured with the 96.96 Dynamic Array (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA). Glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [forward: 5gctctctgctcctcctgttc3, reverse: 5acgaccaaatccgttgactc3, Universal Probe Library (UPL): 60] and glucuronidase beta (GUSB) (forward: 5cgccctgcctatctgtattc3, reverse: 5tccccacagggagtgtgtag3, UPL: 57) were used as reference genes. The Ct values of GAPDH and GUSB were subtracted from the cycle threshold (Ct) values of PLZF (forward: 5caagaagttcagcctcaagca3, reverse: 5cactcaaagggcttctcacc3, UPL: 78) and MR1 (forward: 5gctgtctctgggtccattgt3, reverse: 5gatggctccattttgctctc3, UPL: 20) resulting in Ct values. Those values were then normalized to the highest value of all study samples, respectively. This leads to a relative gene expression, with high values corresponding to high gene expression (relative unit).
The serum concentrations of BAs were measured as described previously 35. In total, 20 bile acids were measured in the serum samples of the 15yearold LISA children. The measurements were carried out with the Biocrates bile acids kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria) on well sandwich filter plates and prepared according to the manufacturers instructions. The liquid chromatography with tandem liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) analysis carried out by means of multiplereaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition using a Waters Acquity UPLC System coupled with QTRAP 5500 (AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Dermany); the triple quadruple mass spectrometers (MS/MS) were operated with electrospray source in negative mode. Target bile acids were chromatographically separated on a reversephase column. Data processing was carried out with the provided quantitation method kit (Biocrates bile acids kit).
In the present investigation, the children of the LISA study were categorized into overweight and normal weight children. To this end, body mass index (BMI) Zscores were calculated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Overweight was defined as a BMI Zscore above the 85th percentile of the entire LISA cohort in the 15th year of life (BMI Zscore > 88). The 5% of children with the lowest BMI Zscore (underweight, BMI Zscore < 1·69) were excluded from the study and the remainder (between the 5th and 85th percentiles) was used as the normal weight group; 41 children were found to be overweight. Of the normal weight group, 41 children were randomly selected for the present investigation. Although all associations in this publication are calculated on the basis of the BMI Zscores, the term body weight is used instead throughout the whole publication for simplicity.
The Ï2 test was used for comparison between characteristics of the entire LISA cohort in the study center in Leipzig and the analyzed subgroups, both at the age of 15 years. The relationship between the analyzed parameters (inflammatory and MAIT cell markers, bile acids) and body weight, parental education, sex and season of blood sampling of the children was determined using the MannWhitney Utest. Odds ratios adjusted for sex, parental education, lifetime prevalence of asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis, as well as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), were calculated in order to show the relationship between body weight and the analyzed parameters. Spearmans rank test was used to analyze the relationship between inflammatory markers, MAIT cell parameters and bile acid concentrations. Data are presented as heatmaps presenting the Spearmans correlation coefficients where significant Pvalues (P < 0·05 and P < 0·0003 after Bonferroni correction) were marked. To further substantiate this relationship, we used a linear regression model adjusted for body weight, sex, parental education, lifetime prevalence of asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis as well as exposure to ETS. For all invitro assays, the oneway analysis of variance (anova) was used to analyze the significance of effects. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica for Windows version 10.0 [Statsoft Inc. (Europe), Hamburg, Germany], GraphPad Prism version 7.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and r version 3.4.3, package gplots.
