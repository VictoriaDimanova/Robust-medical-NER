The demographic and clinical characteristics of study subjects are presented in Supplemental Tables I and II. All patients diagnosed with KD met American Heart Association criteria for KD. Coronary artery dimensions as determined by echocardiography were described by Z-worst, which was defined as the maximal Z score (standard deviation units from the mean) of the internal diameter of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries normalized for body surface area, within the first year after KD onset. A normal coronary artery dimension was defined as a Z-worst < 2.5. CAA with Z-worst¥2.5 included transiently dilated coronary arteries (Z score>2.5 initially, then <2.5 by 6 weeks after fever onset) and aneurysms (internal diameter¥1.5 times the adjacent segment). All KD patients were initially treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) and aspirin (3050 mg/kg/day) during the acute phase. IVIG-resistance was defined as persistent or recrudescent fever (T¥38.0°C rectally or orally) at least 36 hr after the completion of the IVIG infusion. A subset of the KD patients who were either IVIG-resistant, had CAA, or were randomized to the infliximab arm in a clinical trial were treated with a single dose of infliximab 5 mg/kg. Statin-treated subjects were enrolled in a Phase I/IIa dose-escalating clinical trial for KD patients with CAA (NCT01431105). Subjects studied in these experiments received either 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 8.75 mg/day or 17.5 mg/day, respectively, for a 70 kg adult). Convalescent samples were collected from patients after the resolution of the acute illness and after the erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased to <40 mm/h and the C-reactive protein level decreased to <1.0 mg/dl. Age-similar healthy subjects were children undergoing minor elective surgery. The Human Research Protection Program of the University of California San Diego approved this research protocol and written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all subjects and adolescent or child assent was obtained as appropriate. Because serum volume from these young patients was limited, not all assays were performed using sera from every subject.
Isolated lung EC RNA from EC-KLF4/ and EC-KLF4-Tg mice were kindly provided by Dr. Mukesh K. Jain as described. Briefly, lungs were collected from 46 week old mice and treated with type 1 collagenase for 30 min, followed by red blood cell lysis buffer treatment. The remaining cells were plated on collagen coated plates. After cells were grown to confluence and selected for using Dynabeads (Invitrogen) bound to anti-CD102 (BD Biosciences), then re-plated on collagen coated plates until further use.
Human CTGF was quantified by the use of OmniKine¢ ELISA Kit (Assay Biotechnology). Briefly, 2 L of human serum was added to 98 L of dilution buffer and incubated with the capture and secondary antibodies according the manufacturers instructions. The color intensity was measured at 450 nm.
An upstream region from 1500 to +500 bp from the transcriptional start site was defined as the promoter region of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-miR-483 gene. Putative KLF4 binding sites were identified using the MATCH algorithm and the KLF4 position weight matrix from TRANSFAC. Putative miR-483 targeting sites in the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of the CTGF gene were predicted using miRanda linux version V3.3a with parameters set as -sc 55, -scale 2, -en 1, the detailed prediction result showed in Supplemental Fig. I.
The 1044 bp human CTGF 3UTR containing three miR-483 putative binding sites was subcloned (Forward primer: CGGACTAGTTGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGTG, Reverse primer: CGACGCGT ACTTTTGGTCACACTCTCAACA. Restriction enzyme cutting on both ends by Spe I and Mlu I respectively) into the pMIR-REPORT vector (Ambion) to obtain pMIR-Luc-C-3UTR wild-type reporter [Luc-CTGF(WT)]. Using this construct, we introduced GGA to CCT and GTG to CAC mutations in the miR-483 seed sequence of the CTGF 3UTR (Fig. 4E) by using QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK) was used as the transfection control. The constructed plasmids including Luc-CTGF(WT), Luc-CTGF(MT1&2), Luc-CTGF(MT3), and pRL-TK were transfected into bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega).
Ago1-IP was performed as previously described. For ChIP, proteins and DNA were crosslinked with 4% paraformaldehyde and quenched with glycine. HUVECs were then lysed and subjected to sonication. The cell lysates were then incubated with protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies) conjugated to rabbit anti-KLF4 (Cell Signaling) with rabbit IgG as the isotype control. The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR. A complete list of primers used for Ago1-IP and ChIP can be found in Supplemental Table III.
CD31+ MPs were isolated using a procedure adapted from Amabile et al and Chen et al. Briefly, CD31+ MPs were immunoprecipitated from patient sera using anti-CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total RNA from CD31+ MPs was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) with Cel-miR-39 added at 1 nM as a spike-in control.
Endothelial-monocyte adhesion was determined by using the CytoSelect Adhesion Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs) as previously described. Briefly, THP1 monocytes (1x105 cells/well) were labeled with LeukoTracker and incubated with monolayer treated HUVECs for 30 min at 37°C. To quantify monocyte adhesion, a Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader (BioTek) was used to measure fluorescence of lysed cells at 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission.
For normally distributed data, values were expressed as means  SEM. Students t test or ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to analyze differences among groups. For data that were not distributed normally, values were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences between indicated groups. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
