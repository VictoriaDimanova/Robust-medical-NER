Peripheral blood was obtained from patients recruited from the Northeast Early Arthritis Cohort (NEAC) prior to commencement of immunomodulatory treatment. Clinical characteristics of patients recruited in addition to those previously described from these cohorts are provided in Table 1. Healthy donor blood for in vitro culture and dynamic transcriptional profiling was drawn from volunteers into citrate vacuette tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmnster, Austria). For functional experiments leukocyte reduction system (LRS) cones from platelet donations were used. In relation to ex vivo peripheral blood CD4+ T cell Ki67 measurements only, data were similarly available from 25 drug-na¯ve RA patients recruited from the Leeds Early Arthritis Clinic (LEAC), together with 48 age- and sex-matched healthy donors enrolled as previously outlined. Diagnoses of RA were assigned according to contemporaneous classification criteria. All donors gave written informed consent for inclusion in the study and ethical approval was obtained from local ethics committees.
IL-6 in patient serum at baseline was measured as previously described, using electro-chemiluminescence immunosorbance detection system (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersberg, Maryland, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Na¯ve and memory CD4+ T cells were isolated using a RosetteSep Human CD4+ T cell Enrichment Cocktail (Stemcell Technologies) followed by CD45RO MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech), achieving consistent median purities of 82.4 and 78.7%, respectively. For whole CD4+ T cell experiments cells were isolated using monocyte depletion by immuno-rosetting followed by automated magnetic bead-based positive selection (median 99.1% purity; Stemcell Technologies). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield Diagnostics, Dundee, UK).
Culture of 1  106 cells/ml freshly isolated CD4+ T-cells was in serum-free medium alone (TexMACS, Miltenyi Biotech) or with indicated final concentrations of IL-6 and equimolar sIL-6R (both PeproTech EC) in a 1 ml total volume (24-well plate) or 0.5 ml volume (48-well plate) for 72 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Na¯ve CD4+ T cells were labeled with 0.5 M CFSE (eBioscience). Cells were harvested and washed twice, to remove IL-6/sIL-6R, before stimulation for 36 days with plate bound anti-CD3 (0.2 or 0.5 g/ml; eBioscience) and 1 g/ml soluble anti-CD28 (BioLegend). IL-6 in patient serum at baseline was measured as previously described.
Na¯ve and memory CD4+ T cells were differentiated toward T-helper 1 (Th1) or T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, respectively, according to a previously developed protocol. For Th1 cell differentiation experiments, following incubation with serum-free medium alone vs. in the presence of IL-6/sIL-6R na¯ve CD4+ T cells were cultured in a total volume of 1 ml in a 24-well plate at 1  106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FCS. These cells were then cultured with 10 IU/ml IL-2 (Proleukin, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 1 ng/ml IL-12 (PeproTech), 10 g/ml anti-IL-4 (BioLegend), and stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Carsbad, California, USA) at 1 bead: 10 cells ratio. For Th17 differentiation, memory CD4+ T cells were cultured in a total volume of 1 ml in a 24 well plate at 1  106 cells/ml in IMDM supplemented with 10% serum replacement (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured with 10 ng/ml IL-1 (PeproTech), 10 ng/ml IL-23 (PeproTech), 10 ng/ml TGF- (PeproTech), and stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at 1 bead: 50 cells ratio. Cells were cultured 37°C with 5% CO2 and split or refreshed as required. On day six beads were removed using EasySep magnet and cells were rested in IL-2 (10 IU/ml) for 4 days.
All antibodies used in this paper were mouse anti-human. Phosflow was performed on unstimulated whole blood as previously described, employing the following antibodies: anti-CD3-Pacific Blue (UCHT1), anti-Stat3 (pY705)-Alexa Fluor 647 (4/P-STAT3; all BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), CD45RA-PerCP-Cy5.5 (HI100; all BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK); CD62L-PECy7 (DREG-56; both BioLegend); anti-CD4-APC-eFluor 780 (SK3; eBioscience, Hatfield, UK); CD62L-PECy7 (DREG-56; BioLegend). BD Phosflow Lyse/Fix and BD Phosflow Perm Buffer III (both BD Biosciences) were used as per the manufacturers' instructions, data collected on a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, Oregon, USA) using fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) gating.
To measure constitutive IL-6 receptor expression in CD4+ T-cell subsets, whole blood was stained using CD3-BV510 (UCHT1), CD62L-PECy7 (DREG-56), gp130-PE (2E1B02; all BioLegend), CD4-APCef780 (SK3), IL-6R-PerCPeF710 (47.797.1F2; eBioscience), and CD45RA-FITC (HI100; BD Biosciences) before red blood cell lysis and white blood cell fixation using BD FACS Lysing solution (BD Biosciences), as per manufacturer's instructions. A gating strategy, as depicted in Supplementary Figure 1, was used to determine positive IL-6R or gp130 staining. In brief, debris was excluded by SSC-A vs. SSC-W and lymphocytes were gated based on SSC-A vs. FSC-A. A plot of CD4 vs. either IL-6R or gp130 containing all CD3 positive cells was used to determine IL-6R or gp130 positivity. This positive gate was then copied onto the relevant cell population.
Cultured cells were stained for surface markers in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide and 2 mM EDTA) in the presence of 4 g/ml human IgG for 30 min at 4°C; the following antibodies were used: CD4-APCeF780 (SK3; eBioscience), CD3-BV510 (UCHT1), CD25-PECy7 (BC96), CD40L-PE (24-31; BioLegend). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde prior to acquisition. Prior to intracellular cytokine staining cells were cultured for 1 h in the presence of 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 g/ml ionomycin, before the addition of 1 mg/ml Brefeldin-A (BFA) (all Sigma Aldrich) for 4 h. BFA-exposed cells cultured in the absence of PMA/ionomycin were stained in parallel and used as negative controls for gating. After staining with Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend), surface antibodies were CD3-PB or CD3-BUV395 (UCHT1) and CD4-PerCP or CD4-BV786 (SK3; BD Biosciences); fixation and permeabilization was with the FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer (eBioscience) according to manufacturer's instructions, and intracellular staining was with IFN--FITC(4S.B3; eBioscience) and IL-17-APC-Cy7 (BL168; BioLegend).
Constitutive intracellular levels of Ki67 were measured in unstimulated early RA/control PBMC by staining with Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend) and then CD4-PerCP (SK3; BD Biosciences) before fixation/permeabilization and staining with Ki67-PE (B56; BD Biosciences) or isotype control (MOPC-21; BD Biosciences), again using FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer. For measurement of constitutive surface CD25 expression, staining was with CD25 PECy7 (BC96, BioLegend), CD3-BUV395 (UCHT1, BioLegend), and CD4-FITC (RPA-T4, BioLegend), gated using CD3 positive, CD4 negative cells. Cells stained for intracellular proteins were collected on a FACS Canto II or Fortessa X20 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, Oregon, USA), as before. Debris was excluded by SSC-A vs. SSC-W and live cells were gated based on exclusion of the viability dye. CD4+ T cells were gated as CD3+CD4+ and further examined, with further gating against negative control cells. Proliferation was calculated using the proliferation tool on FlowJo and reported as division index, the average number of cell divisions a cell in the original population has undergone.
RNA was extracted from na¯ve and memory CD4+ T-cells at indicated experimental time-points using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 1,000 UV Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to generation/hybridization of cRNA to the Illumina Human HT-12 v4.0 microarray (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Raw data processing and further data analysis was performed in R software version 3.3.0, using the Bioconductor packages. Variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) and Robust Spline Normalization (RSN) were carried out in the lumi package and differentially expressed genes were identified using the moderated paired t-test implemented in the limma package, with a fold-change of 1.5 and p < 0.05 after correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed gene lists was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen). Hypergeometric testing was carried out in order to determine the probability of genes differentially expressed between early RA and disease controls occurring in IL-6 exposed na¯ve CD4+ T cells. Expression data used in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE131866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).
Additional statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software Inc). Non-parametric analysis of variance (Friedman's test; Dunn's post hoc pairwise analyses), Mann-Whitney U-tests and Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used for comparisons of multiple paired groups, two unpaired groups or two paired groups, respectively. Spearman's rank was used for correlation analyses. P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant.
