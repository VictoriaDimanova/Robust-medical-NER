Murine C2C12 SkM myoblasts (Blau et al.,; Yaffe & Saxel,) were first seeded (1106 cells) onto pregelatinized (0.2% in dH2O; Type A; SigmaAldrich) T75 flasks (Nunc¢; Thermo Fisher Scientific) within a Class II biological safety cabinet (BSC; Kojair) and expanded in growth media composed of high glucose (4.5g/L) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, including 4mM  l Glutamine (LG; SigmaAldrich), 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (hiFBS; SLS), 10% heatinactivated newborn calf serum (hiNBCS; Fisher Scientific, Denmark), supplemented with an additional 2mM LG (Lonza), 100 U/ml penicillin100g/ml streptomycin (PS; Lonza) in a humidified incubator (HERAcell 150i; Thermo Scientific) at 37°C, 5% CO2 until 80% confluency was attained. Once confluent, cells were washed twice with sterile phosphatebuffered saline (1 PBS; SigmaAldrich), trypsinized (0.05% Trypsin/0.02% EDT; SigmaAldrich), and counted using the trypan blue exclusion method (0.4% trypan blue; SigmaAldrich).
Murine C2C12 bioengineered SkM was prepared as previously described in detail elsewhere (Khodabukus & Baar,; Martin et al.,; Seaborne et al.,; Turner et al.,). Briefly, 26mm silk suture threads (Ethicon Mersilk, 2.0) were pinned 12mm apart using 0.15mm Minutien pins (Entomoravia) within sylgardcoated (Sylgard¢ 184 Elastomer Kit; Dow Corning) 35mm culture dishes (EasyGrip, BD Falcon; VWR). Culture dishes were filled with 70% ethanol and left to air dry under UV (programmed to 1h) overnight in a Class II BSC. Once sterilized, 500l GM containing 10 U/ml thrombin (T4648; SigmaAldrich), 8l/ml aprotinin (10mg/ml; A3428; SigmaAldrich), and 0.5mg/ml 6aminocaproic acid (6AA) were added to each culture dish and agitated to ensure the entire surface was covered. Twohundred microliters of fibrinogen (20mg/ml; F8630; SigmaAldrich) were added dropwise and left to incubate at room temperature (RT) for 10min before transferring to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 1h to polymerize. Following polymerization, C2C12 cells were seeded onto the fibrin gel at a concentration of 9104 cells/ml in 2ml GM containing 0.5mg/ml 6AA and 50M of both  l ascorbic acid (A4403; SigmaAldrich) and  l proline (LP; P8865; SigmaAldrich). GM was changed every 48h until cells were approximately 90% confluent, at which point the media was switched to differentiation media (DM; same composition as GM with the exception of increased 6AA to 1mg/ml and reduced serum to 2% using heatinactivated horse serum, hiHS; Figure 1). Following 48h in DM, fibrin gels were washed 2PBS and media was changed to maintenance medium (MM; same components as GM with reduced 3.5% hiFBS and 3.5% hiNBCS serum and increased 1mg/ml 6AA). MM was changed every 48h and a 0.5ml topup of MM was provided on days where media was not changed until constructs had matured into cylindricallike muscles with uniaxial myotubes by day 14 (Figure 1d). At day 14, construct width was assessed using digital Vernier calipers (all displaying <4mm at the narrowest point of the construct) for all constructs used for loading experiments (Khodabukus & Baar,; Khodabukus et al.,).
The TC3 tension bioreactor system (EBERS Medical Technology) was used to mechanically load bioengineered SkM constructs (Figure 2a). After 14 days in culture, bioengineered muscle constructs displaying healthy aligned myotubes (Figure 1d) that also spontaneously twitch in situ (Video  Supplementary File 1) were randomly selected for both loaded (n=45 replicate cultures) and nonloaded (n=45 replicate cultures) conditions. Constructs were transferred to the bioreactor chambers and submerged in 20ml MM (Figure 2b). Chambers were attached to the bioreactor system, housed in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) ready to undergo mechanical loading. Nonloaded controls were kept at resting length (12mm) for 1h. Loaded constructs were subject to 10% (1.2mm) stretch (which increases myotube hypertrophy, myoblast differentiation, and candidate anabolic gene expression in bioengineered SkM; Heher et al.,; Player et al.,; Powell et al.,) for 4 sets10 repetitions (frequency of 0.3Hz, 0.4mm/s). Each set was interspersed with 90s rest and repeated five times. Every 4 sets of 10 repetitions were separated by 3.5min rest, totaling an intermittent regime over 1h, matching the nonloaded control duration. Following the cessation of mechanical loading, constructs were kept at resting length (12mm) and sampled at 0.5, 3, and 24h after loading.
Bioengineered SkM muscle constructs were stained and imaged as previously described (Seaborne et al.,). Briefly, on day 14, muscle constructs were washed 3  in Trisbuffered saline (TBS; 1; SigmaAldrich) and fixed using icecold methanol:acetone:TBS (25:25:50) for 15min, and then a further 15min in methanol:acetone (50:50) only. After a further 3  washes, culture dishes were wrapped in parafilm and stored at 4°C until required for immunostaining. Following fixation, pins were removed, and constructs were transferred to 2ml Eppendorf tubes using angled forceps. Bioengineered muscle samples were then permeabilized (0.2% Triton X100) and blocked (5% goat serum) in TBS (1) for 1.5 h and incubated overnight (4°C) in 250l of phalloidinfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody (P5282; SigmaAldrich) at a concentration of 50g/ml. After overnight incubation, the secondary antibody was aspirated, and gels were washed 3in TBS Before adding 250l of 4,6diamidino2phenylindole (DAPI; 300nM) for 90min to counterstain myonuclei (Figure 2c). Once stained, muscle constructs were transferred to nonsylgardcoated culture dishes containing 2ml of TBS and were wrapped in parafilm and foil, then stored at 4°C until required for fluorescence imaging. Immunostained constructs were visualized using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX83) and imaged using supporting software (FV10ASW 4.2; Olympus) to illustrate the alignment of mature myotubes via detection of factin (phalloidinFITC, green) and myonuclei (DAPI, blue; Figure 2c).
Following the cessation of mechanical loading, bioengineered muscle constructs were removed from the bioreactor chambers at 0.5, 3, and 24h postloading. Both loaded and nonloaded muscle constructs were transferred to MagNA Lyser Green Bead tubes (Roche) containing either 1ml TRIzol (Invitrogen¢; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 600l of Buffer RLT (AllPrep RNA/DNA Mini Kit; Qiagen) containing 6l Mercaptoethanol (SigmaAldrich) when isolating RNA using the TRIzol (for analyzing genes identified in Seaborne et al.,) or AllPrep RNA/DNA Mini Kit (for analyzing genes identified in Turner et al.,) methods, respectively. Samples were transferred to a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche, MagNA lyser) and were homogenized (45s at 6000rpm, repeated 3 with samples placed on ice for 5min after each disruption). Concentrations were quantified using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop¢ 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). A onestep PCR kit (QuantiFast¢ SYBR Green; Qiagen) was used to assess gene expression. Samples were first diluted in nucleasefree H2O to ensure a concentration of 35ng RNA in 10l volume, made up of 4.75l (7.37ng/l) RNA sample and 5.25l of master mix (MM) composed of 5l SYBR green, 0.1l of reverse transcriptase (RT) and 0.075l of both forward and reverse primers (both 100µM stock concentration) in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction tubes (0.1ml strips and caps; Qiagen). Primers were designed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) to identify gene regions, which shared the same sequence across all transcript variants. Specificity was confirmed via BLAST and melt curve analysis. Primers were purchased from SigmaAldrich. All primer sequence and location information are detailed in Supplementary File 2. PCR amplification was performed using a quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR thermal cycler (Rotorgene 3000Q; Qiagen) and the following protocol: 10min hold at 50°C (reverse transcription/cDNA synthesis), 95°C for 5min (transcriptase inactivation and initial denaturation step) and PCR Steps of 40 cyclesÍ¾ 95°C for 10s (denaturation), 60°C for 30s (annealing and extension). Upon completion, melt curve analyses confirmed that only one gene product (i.e., the gene of interest) was amplified. Gene expression was determined using the  C t equation (Schmittgen & Livak,). The pooled CT values from the nonloaded controls at each individual time point (0.5, 3, and 24h) were used as the calibrator condition and were relativized to the mean C t value of the reference gene, RPII (18.640.74, with a low 3.97% variation). PCR efficiencies were similar for the reference gene (RPII, 92.245.43%, variation 5.88%) and genes of interest (93.645.91%, variation 6.31%).
The DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was used to purify DNA from loaded/nonloaded bioengineered SkM when assessing the DNA methylation status of genes previously identified in Seaborne et al.,, including ODF2, UBR5, TRAF1, and GRIK2 (all sequencing information and raw data for these genes is presented in Supplementary File 3a,b). The AllPrep RNA/DNA Mini Kit was used to copurify RNA/DNA from muscle constructs when assessing DNA methylation of genes identified in Turner et al.,, including MSN, WNT9a, GSK3, TIMP3, and CTTN (all sequencing information and raw data for these genes is presented in Supplementary File 3c,d). After DNA extractions, concentrations and purities were quantified using a NanoDrop. Twohundred and fifty nanograms of extracted DNA/sample was bisulfite converted using the EZ96 DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research Corp.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Bisulfite converted DNA was eluted in 46µl of Melution buffer and amplified via multiplex PCR. Briefly, each 20l PCR reaction consisting of 0.5 U HotStarTaq Polymerase (Qiagen), 0.2M of forward and reverse primers for the gene of interest reported above and 2l of bisulfitetreated DNA was amplified as follows: 95°C for 15min (transcriptase inactivation and initial denaturation step) and then 45cycles of 95°C for 30s (denaturation), 30s annealing (the annealing temperature for each assay is described in Supplementary File 3), 72°C for 5min (extension). After amplification, all PCR products were verified and quantified using the QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen). Before library preparation, PCR products from the same sample were pooled and purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit columns (Qiagen). Libraries were then prepared by EpigenDx (Hopkinton). Library molecules were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using the Qiagen QIAxcel Advanced System. Template preparation and enrichment were performed using the Ion Chef system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Ion 520¢ and Ion 530¢. ExT Chef reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Enriched templatepositive library molecules were sequenced using the Ion S5¢ sequencer using an Ion 530¢ sequencing chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific). FASTQ files from the Ion Torrent S5 server were aligned to the local reference database using the opensource Bismark Bisulfite Read Mapper with the Bowtie2 alignment algorithm. Methylation levels were calculated in Bismark by dividing the number of methylated reads by the total number of reads (presented in Supplementary File 3b,d). If a data set displayed less than 30 reads, the results were considered unreliable and were therefore excluded from further analysis.
To compare the transcriptional and epigenetic responses after loading in bioengineered SkM with those following RE in humans, data were compared to that already obtained in our group from eight healthy young (27.62.4 years, 82.56.0kg, 178.12.8cm, meansSEM) males who undertook a single bout of RE (Seaborne et al.,). Briefly, following a week of familiarization, untrained male participants performed an acute bout of RE consisting of several lower body exercises, including the back squat, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, Nordic curls, weighted lunges, and calf raises. Each exercise session consisted of 4 sets10 reps, ~90120s rest between sets and ~3min rest after every 4 sets of 10 reps, totaling a regime of ~1h. SkM biopsies were obtained at 0.5h post exercise to determine changes in gene expression and DNA methylation. Ethical approval was granted by the NHS West Midlands Black Country, UK, Research Ethics Committee (NREC approval no. 16/WM/0103).
To compare the loading response in fibrinbioengineered muscle with the responses to resistance training (RT) in rodent SkM, adult (6 months) male Wistar rats were subject to programmed RT via intermittent highfrequency (100Hz) electrical stimulation as previously described (Schmoll et al.,; Seaborne et al.,). Briefly, under anesthesia with 2% inhaled isoflurane and buprenorphine I.M. injection at 0.1mg/kg, rodents were implanted with a miniature stimulator sutured into the abdominal cavity with electrodes placed near the common peroneal and tibial nerves. The muscles were electrically stimulated to ensure that the dorsiflexors worked against the plantarflexors, and therefore the dorsiflexors were loaded. The stimulation consisted of an intermittent regime of highfrequency (100Hz) stimulation once a day for 4 weeks (5 sets10 reps, each repetition lasted 2s with a 2s rest between repetitions and 2.5min rest between sets). This regime leads to a 14% and 19% increase in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle weight and fiber CSA, respectively (Schmoll et al.,; Seaborne et al.,). Following the cessation of electrical stimulation, RNA was isolated from the TA muscle of the stimulated and contralateral unstimulated (control) limbs (n=5) using the TRIzol method as described above. Experimental procedures were conducted according to permissions within a project license granted under the British Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Death was achieved by rising CO2 (100% CO2 at a flow rate of ~20% of chamber volume) followed by cervical dislocation.
A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted using Minitab software (Version 18) to determine main effects for multiple genes across conditions (loaded/nonloaded) and time (0.5, 3 and 24h) in bioengineered SkM. Unpaired t tests were conducted using GraphPad software (Prism, Version 7.0a) when assessing gene expression and DNA methylation between loaded and nonloaded bioengineered muscle. A oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis (Tukey HSD) enabled detection of significant differences between loaded bioengineered SkM, human RE, and rodent RT for genes identified in Seaborne et al.,. A twoway mixed ANOVA (23) was performed using Minitab software (Version 18) to detect statistically significant interactions for condition (loaded/nonloaded) and time (0.5, 3, and 24h) when assessing genes that were significantly altered across the methylome and transcriptome after acute human RE in Turner et al.,. Post hoc analysis (Tukey HSD) was carried out to confirm statistical significance between conditions (loaded/nonloaded) and within time (0.5, 3, and 24h) whenever significant interactions were observed. Pooled transcriptome analysis in Turner et al., generated mean expression values across all pooled transcriptome studies in the literature when the first analysis was conducted (April 2019), rather than expression values for each individual study. Therefore, unpaired t tests were conducted following oneway ANOVA analysis to determine where significant differences between models (loaded bioengineered muscle, human RE, and rodent RT) occurred when analyzing genes identified in Turner et al.,. The alpha value of significance was set at p.05. All data are presented as the meanSEM.
