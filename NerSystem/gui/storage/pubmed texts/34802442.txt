This phase 1 study was planned to be composed of two parts. The first part, performed as planned, was an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of single doses of the GAP vaccine administered intravenously. The second part was planned to provide preliminary information on the efficacy of the GAP vaccine by determining the protective immune response of GAP vaccination to subsequent challenge with wild-type blood-stage P. falciparum. However, it was decided not to proceed with the second part due to the lack of complete attenuation of the GAP vaccine, and alloimmunization events, observed in the first part (see the Results section). The study design and methodology for the second part of the study are not described here.
Healthy malaria na¯ve males aged 18 to 55years were eligible for inclusion in the study (for full eligibility criteria see Additional File 1: Text S1). The study was conducted at Q-Pharm (Brisbane, Australia) and was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial ID: ACTRN12617000824369; date registered: 06 June 2017).
The manufacture of the GAP vaccine has been described previously. Briefly, genetically attenuated blood-stage malaria parasites were produced by targeted deletion of kahrp from P. falciparum strain 3D7, and parasites were cultured in a wave bioreactor under GMP-compliant conditions. The cryopreserved GAP master cell bank was tested for sterility, absence of viral contaminants and endotoxins, and parasite identity, viability, and antimalarial drug sensitivity. The GAP master cell bank has a parasitemia of 6.3% with 96% of parasites at ring stage. The GAP vaccine inoculum used for each subject in this study was prepared aseptically from a single vial of the GAP master cell bank by thawing, washing, and suspending the appropriate number of infected erythrocytes in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection in a final volume of 2mL. Syringes containing the inocula were stored at a controlled temperature for a maximum of 2h before administration.
The study was conducted in four consecutive dose cohorts of two subjects each. Sample size was not based on formal statistical calculations but was considered appropriate to achieve the study objectives. Following a screening period of up to 28days, subjects were inoculated intravenously with the GAP vaccine (day 0). A sentinel dosing strategy was used for the first three cohorts whereby the first subject in each cohort was inoculated with the GAP vaccine at least 24h before the second subject. Subjects in cohort 4 were inoculated with the GAP vaccine concurrently since no significant safety signals had been observed in the preceding cohorts.
Parasitemia was monitored throughout the study by collecting blood samples and performing quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the gene encoding P. falciparum 18S rRNA. Subjects were to receive a standard curative course of artemether/lumefantrine treatment if parasitemia reached ¥5000 parasites/mL (¥200,000 parasites/mL for cohort 4) or if clinical symptoms of malaria were observed (clinical symptom score >6), or on day 283 (day 603 for cohort 4) if the preceding treatment criteria had not been reached earlier. The end of the study visit occurred on day 90 for safety and immunogenicity assessments.
The GAP vaccine dose administered to cohort 1 was 1800 viable parasites which is the dose of P. falciparum 3D7 wild-type parasites routinely used in previous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies using the induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model. A formal Safety Review Team meeting was conducted between cohorts to assess the safety of the GAP vaccine and decide whether to dose escalate and proceed with the next cohort. The planned dose escalation was 1.8 105 viable parasites for cohort 2 (100-fold increase from cohort 1) and 3 106 viable parasites for cohort 3 (a dose of parasites equivalent to that released from the liver after a five mosquito bite CHMI study). Based on the results observed in cohort 3 (with both subjects developing parasitemia but remaining asymptomatic), the study protocol was amended to include a fourth cohort administered the same GAP vaccine dose as cohort 3 (3 106 viable parasites), but with the antimalarial treatment criteria amended with a longer follow-up to allow for better characterization of parasite infectivity. A planned protocol deviation was performed for cohort 3 due to the unexpected results observed; subject 6 was administered antimalarial treatment on day 35 when parasitemia reached 5000 parasites/mL instead of the protocol stipulated day 28. This was considered reasonable since the subject was asymptomatic and consented to the additional period of follow-up. The QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Human Research Ethics Committee was notified of this decision.
Safety assessments were performed throughout the study and included adverse event (AE) recording, physical examinations, vital signs monitoring, electrocardiographs (ECGs), clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), and malaria clinical score recording. The severity of AEs was graded according to a set of criteria developed for guidance of commonly reported symptoms, signs, and abnormal laboratory findings in malaria challenge studies (mild = grade 1; moderate = grade 2; severe = grade 3). These were adapted from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0.
The development of an antibody response to the GAP vaccine was determined by collecting blood samples and using standard ELISA methods to measure IgG and IgM antibodies towards P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) and to whole parasite lysate (Additional File 2: Text S1). The development of a cell-mediated immune response to the GAP vaccine (cohorts 1-3 only) was determined by collecting blood samples and using flow cytometry to identify T cell subsets (Additional File 2: Text S2, Table S1, and Figure S1).
A series of in vitro analyses were performed on parasites isolated from the blood of subjects at maximum parasitemia prior to antimalarial treatment. Parasites were cultured directly from blood samples to reach a target parasitemia of 2-8% with >50% ring stage parasites before cryopreservation. The properties of the isolated parasites were compared to parasites inoculated on day 0. Genotyping of the parasite genetic material was performed using standard molecular biology techniques including Sanger sequencing and whole genome sequencing (Additional File 3: Text S1). The cytoadherence phenotype of the isolates was determined using both static and flow adhesion assays (Additional File 3: Text S2). Scanning electron microscopy was performed to characterize the knob status of parasite-infected erythrocytes (Additional File 3: Text S3). The var gene expression profile of parasites was determined using diagnostic RT-PCR (Additional File 3: Text S4 and Table S1).
