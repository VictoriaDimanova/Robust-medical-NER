Patients from the clinical trial at one site who gave informed consent under a separate IRB-approved protocol provided 40ml of peripheral blood once prior to initiation of study medication or placebo and once at 20  2 weeks during active treatment or placebo.
PBMC were isolated from blood using Histopaque-1077 density centrifugation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO). PBMC were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing L-glutamine, 10% human AB serum, 25mM HEPES (Gibco/Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Fisher scientific).
Recombinant genotype 1a-derived HCV core (SOD-c22, aa 2-120), NS3/4 (SOD-c200, aa 1192-1931) NS5 (SOD-NS5, aa 2054-2995), and control superoxide dismutase (SOD) proteins were generously provided by Novartis Diagnostics (Emeryville, CA). Tetanus toxoid 0.5ug/ul (Sigma) and Candida albicans 20ug/ul (Sigma) were utilized as antigen positive controls.
CD4+ T-cell proliferation assay was performed as previously described. Briefly, PBMC (2x105 cells/well) were stimulated for 7 days with SOD-c22, SOD-c200, and SOD-NS5 and controls and harvested after 16 hours of 3H-thymidine incorporation (1Ci/well) (Dupont NEN, Boston, MA). As a positive control, PBMC were stimulated with a T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 2 g/mL and harvested on day 4. The results were expressed as a stimulation index (SI) with mean counts per minute (cpm) in stimulated wells divided by the mean cpm in control wells. SI greater than 3 was considered positive. Testing of in vitro T-cell suppression was performed using PBMC (12x105 cells/well) with and without 2 g/mL PHA in presence of silymarin (Sigma) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 g/ml.
The frequency of IFN and IL-10 producing T-cells were quantified by Elispot assay, performed using 2 x 105 PBMC/well in triplicates with and without HCV and control antigens as described previously. HCV-specific CD4+T cell IFN (Th1) or IL-10 (Tr1) responses in whole PBMC was examined using recombinant HCV and control proteins (10g/ml). Spot forming units (SFU) were counted using IFL04 Elispot reader (AID, Hamburg, Germany). HCV-specific IFN or IL-10 T-cell frequency was calculated by subtracting the mean SFU in negative control wells from mean SFU in antigen-stimulated wells and expressed as HCV-specific SFU/106 PBMC.
2 x 105 PBMC were stained with 7-actinomycin-D/Viaprobe, CD69 FITC, CD25 PE, CD45RO APC, CD4 PE-Cy7, CD4 APC (all BD Bioscience), CD4 APC-Alexa Fluor 750 (eBioscience), foxp3 FITC (eBioscience) as previously described. All samples where acquired using FACS Diva software on a FACSCanto, and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar Inc., Ashland OR).
Freshly isolated plasma from whole blood were aliquoted and stored at 80c for cytokine analysis of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF, TNF, and IFN using Milliplex MAP Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) on a Luminex 200 system (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) using Masterplex QT software (Hitachi/MiraiBio, South San Francisco, CA) and IP-10 by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Cryopreserved PBMC from pre- and on-treatment samples from 6 patients from each treatment assignment were thawed and cultured overnight in RPMI 10%ABS media with or without stimulation using rhIFN (0.1ng/ml) or PHA (2 g/mL). Using Taqman Gene expression kits and Cells-to-CT kit (Applied Bioscience), mRNA levels for 18S RNA, GAPDH, IRF7, Mx1, PP2A, ISG15, USP18 and STAT1 were measured on ABI 7000 rtPCR system (Applied Bioscience) and analyzed by Ct methodology.
The median values for clinical and immunologic parameters at individual time points were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Wilcoxon Rank Sum or Mann-Whitney U test. MANOVA for repeat measures was utilized to determine the significance of the difference of pre-and on-treatment immunological results across treatment assignment. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 9 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
