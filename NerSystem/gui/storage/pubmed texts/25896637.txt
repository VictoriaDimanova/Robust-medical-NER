Inclusion criteria were as those applied in our previous study, namely, genetically and clinically confirmed diagnosis of LOTS (compound heterozygotes carrying the G269S/c.1278insTACT mutation); lack of contraindications for the use of PMT and patients interest in close surveillance at the study center. Exclusion criteria for participation in this study were any known sensitivity to PMT, the presence of known or convulsive disease, and any serious medical illness such as cardiac disease, hematologic abnormality, or malabsorbtion. In all, 4 out of the 9 with LOTS participating in our previous study expressed interest to enroll into this modified continuation protocol and were all found eligible.
Subjects were assessed every 48 weeks apart by a multidisciplinary team including a neurologist, psychiatrist and a specialist in internal medicine. As part of this assessment, HexA activity was also assessed every 48 weeks, at each of the evaluation points. PMT was prescribed at a dose of 6.25 mg taken orally 3 times a week (~2.7 mg/day). This dose was chosen according to the results obtained from our previous study, in which PMTs effect on HexA activity and tolerability was examined in 9 patients at a dose range reaching up to 75 mg PMT/day. In that former study, PMT at a dose of 6.25 mg taken orally 3 times a week was effective in increasing HexA activity, yet it induced no side effects. In the present study we sought to evaluate the long term effect of the low dose of PMT and maintained therapy as long as no appreciable clinical or biochemical side effects were noted and HexA activity did not decline by more than 25% as compared to the pre-treatment level. Folic acid (5 mg/day) was added with the initiation of PMT. Mean duration of the active PMT treatment was 82.8 (22.5) weeks.
The primary outcome measures were the changes in HexA activity in peripheral lymphocytes as well as the safety and tolerability of PMT therapy in LOTS patients in a long term, low dose protocol. The secondary outcome measures included potential changes in neurological and psychomotor status of PMT-treated LOTS patients as defined by the itemized description below.
The study was approved by the institutional IRB as well as by the Israeli Ministry of Health Review Board for clinical trials and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual participating in the study.
Disability was assessed by the Standard ambulation index and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS). The up & go test was used to measure mobility. Handgrip strength was assessed by means of dynamometry in both hands. Manual muscle strength was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. The assessed muscle functions included shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, finger extension, hip flexion, knee extension and flexion and foot dorsiflexion. Muscle strength was rated for right and left side and expressed as means of the two sides. Gait and balance were assessed by the Tinetti Gait and Balance Scale, and the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale.
Psychiatric evaluation was carried out by patient interview on each visit by the same psychiatrist. Diagnosis was made according DSM IV-R criteria. The Hamilton questionnaire (HAM-21) was used for depression rating and the PANSS questionnaire was used for the evaluation of psychosis.
Lymphocyte HexA enzymatic activity was determined with 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-N-acetyl--D-glucosaminide (MUGS) as a fluorogenic substrate as previously described. In brief, cell extracts were prepared from whole blood on the day of blood collection using standard methods and stored in aliquots at 20°C. To determine HexA activity, 4 g of lymphocyte extract protein were incubated with MUGS (0.7 mM; Melford Laboratories, Suffolk, UK) in a 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.5; 37°C) over 1.5 hour. Fluorescence of the liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured by Synergy 2 fluorometer ((BioTek Instruments, Inc Winooski, US; excitation 335 nm, emission 442 nm) and normalized for protein content. To minimize inter-assay variations, each determination throughout the study also included extracts from the baseline sample and at least one additional sample from the intervention period. As variations in the ratio between this historical and baseline activity on repeat measurements did not exceed /10%, assessment of the current (treatment) sample relative to baseline activity for each sample could be safely made within the same assay. Extracts were stable in terms of enzyme activity for at least one year. Because the study lasted for ~1.5 years, new extracts were prepared and compared with the original baseline, so as to form a credibly stable extract for continued comparative assessment. Calculated intra-assay imprecision was 10.5% and inter-assay imprecision was 26%. Biological variation in heterozygotes was 2.1%.
All endpoints and data were summarized using descriptive statistics (mean values with standard deviations) and non-parametric t-test using SPSS. HexA activity was calculated and presented as percent change from baseline.
