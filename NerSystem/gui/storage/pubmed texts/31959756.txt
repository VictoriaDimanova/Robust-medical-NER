The main results of the PAMELA neoadjuvant phase II study have been previously reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01973660, and it is completed. The study protocol was approved by independent ethics committees at each center. In this trial, 151 patients with early HER2+breast cancer were treated with neoadjuvant lapatinib (1000mg daily) and trastuzumab (8mgkg1 i.v. loading dose followed by 6mgkg1) for 18 weeks. Patients with HR+breast cancer received letrozole or tamoxifen according to menopausal status. Tumor samples were collected at baseline, day 14 and surgery and subsequently formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). As previously reported, Ki67 was evaluated by IHC on FFPE tissue sections from core biopsies at baseline and at day 14 of treatment. These data are provided as a Source Data file.
The main results of the LPT109096 neoadjuvant phase II study have been previously reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00524303. In this trial, 100 patients with early HER2+breast cancer were randomized to lapatinib, trastuzumab or both. Patients received 2 weeks of treatment without chemotherapy, and after a tumor biopsy, they received the same anti-HER2 treatment in combination with chemotherapy consisting of 5FU 500mgm2+epirubicin 75mgm2+cyclophosphamide 500mgm2 i.v. every 21 days (FEC75) for four cycles followed by weekly paclitaxel 80mgm2 for 12 weeks. Trastuzumab was administered every week (4mgkg1 i.v. loading dose followed by 2mgkg1). Lapatinib was administered every day (1250mg if given without chemotherapy, 750mg during FEC75 and 1000mg during paclitaxel). Tumor samples were collected at baseline and day 14 and subsequently FFPE according to protocol.
The breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and MCF7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). All cell lines were maintained as recommended by the suppliers. All cell lines were authenticated using Human 9-Marker STR Profile and Interspecies Contamination Test by IDEXX BioAnalytics. Lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib and palbociclib were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). Trastuzumab was obtained from Roche Farma (Basel, Switzerland). A BT474-derived lapatinib and trastuzumab resistant (BT474-LRTR) cell line and a BT474-derived tucatinib and trastuzumab resistant (BT474-TuRTR) cell line were established by treating BT474 with the corresponding TKI plus trastuzumab for 6 months, starting at low concentrations and increasing them at each passage. BT474-LRTR are maintained with 2nM lapatinib+2µgml1 trastuzumab, while BT474-TuRTR are maintained with 2nM tucatinib+2µg1ml trastuzumab.
RNA samples of the PAMELA trial from baseline and day 14 of treatment were previously extracted as reported. Here, we extracted RNA from 57 residual surgical tumor FFPE material (non-pCR) from the PAMELA trial and 36 pairs of FFPE tumor samples (baseline and day 14) from the LPT109096 study using the High Pure FFPET RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following manufacturers protocol. At least 15 10m FFPE slides were used for each tumor specimen, and macrodissection was performed to avoid contamination with normal breast tissue if needed. The RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract RNA from cell lines plated in triplicates in 6-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells per well. RNA was quantified at the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
RNA samples of the PAMELA trial from HER2-E tumors at baseline (n=101) and day 14 of treatment (n=96) were previously analyzed. Here, the nCounter platform (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, Washington, USA) analyzed RNA samples from 57 residual tumors from the PAMELA trial, RNA from 36 paired tumors from the LPT109096 study, and RNA from cell lines treated with anti-HER2 and anti-CDK4/6 therapies. A minimum of 100ng of total RNA was used to measure the expression of 50 genes of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype predictor assay and 5 housekeeping genes (ACTB, MRPL19, PSMC4, RPLP0 and SF3A1). Expression counts were then normalized using the nSolver 4.0 software and custom scripts in R 3.4.3. For each sample we calculated the PAM50 signature scores (Basal-like, HER2-E, Luminal A and B, normal-like) and the proliferation signature score. These data are provided as a Source Data file.
Cells were plated in triplicate at 4000 cells per well in 96-well plates. The day after seeding, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TKI (lapatinib, neratinib and tucatinib) and 10µgml1 trastuzumab. Cell viability was determined 72h after treatment using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) following the manufacturers instructions, and quantified using the Gen5 Microplate Reader and Imager Software (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA). For anti-CDK4/6 treatments, cells were plated in triplicate at 4000 cells per well in 96-well plates and treated at low doses of TKI or DMSO for 24h. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations palbociclib in combination with low doses of TKI or DMSO. At 72h, cells were labeled with the DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and fluorescence was subsequently determined at the Gen5 Microplate Reader and Imager Software. GraphPad Prism was used for statistics. These data are provided as a Source Data file.
Cells were plated in triplicate at 150,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and treated with TKI and trastuzumab. Cell lysates were collected after 24h of treatment with Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitors: 5µM NaF, 1µM PMSF, 1µM Na3O4V, 1µM benzamidine, 1µgml1 aprotinin, 1µM leupeptin, 1µM DTT. Total protein extracts were quantified using the DC Protein Assay (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA). 25g of proteins were separated in reducing conditions (2.5% -mercaptoethanol) by SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) for further processing, following standard Western blotting procedures. Primary antibodies used in this study were: HER2 (D8F12), Phospho-HER2 (Tyr1221/1222) (6B12), AKT, Phospho-Akt (Ser473) (D9E), Phospho-RB (Ser807/811) (D20B12), Cyclin D1 (92G2) and anti-GAPDH (14C10) rabbit antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies (Massachusetts, USA). The secondary fluorescent antibody used was the IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Fluorescent signal was acquired by the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Uncropped blots are provided as a Source Data file.
BC cell lines were fixed in 70% cold ethanol after 72h of treatment with combinations of 10µgml1 trastuzumab and TKI (10nM lapatinib, 2nM neratinib or 10nM tucatinib) or with DMSO control. Propidium Iodide (PI) was used to stain total DNA. Data acquisition was performed at the Cytometry and cell sorting core facilities of the Institut dInvestigacions Biom¨diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS) using a BD FacsDiva analyzer. GraphPad Prism was used for statistics. These data are provided as a Source Data file.
Breast cancer cell lines were plated at low density in 6-well plates and treated with combinations of 10µgml1 trastuzumab and TKI (10nM lapatinib, 2nM neratinib or 10nM tucatinib) or with DMSO control. After 10 days, cells were fixed with cold methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution.
To identify genes and signatures whose expression was significantly different between paired samples (baseline vs day 14 or day 14 vs. surgery for clinical samples, or untreated vs treated for cell lines) or unpaired samples (parental cell lines vs anti-HER2 resistant cell lines) we used two-class paired Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with a false discovery rate (FDR)<5%. All statistical tests were two sided, and the statistical significance level was set to <0.05.
