Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were sectioned and enriched for tumour tissue by macro-dissection. Genomic DNA was extracted by using the QIAamp FFPE Tissue kit and amplified using the Ion AmpliseqTM Library Kit 2.0. DNA sequencing was performed by the IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA). A targeted cancer hotspot panel (designed using the Ion AmpliseqTM Cancer Primer Pool) was used to detect mutations in 46 known cancer-related genes (Supplementary Table 1). The sensitivity of this assay is 510% (% of mutant DNA detectable in a background of wild-type DNA). When DNA was of insufficient quality for next-generation sequencing (NGS), pyrosequencing was used to test for mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of NRAS.
Tumour FFPE tissue was macro-dissected from 1 to 25-µm sections, RNA extracted using the RNeasy FFPE kit according to the manufacturers instructions and 100ng of each RNA was analysed using the NanoString nCounter gene expression system. The code set was designed by NanoString Inc. (Seattle, WA). Transcript counts were normalised between MEK signature genes and reference genes and transformed using the NanoString Normalisation Tool v2 (AstraZeneca Oncology Bioinformatics http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NAPPA) in order to generate signature scores. Signature scores were calculated blind to clinical outcomes.
CHL-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and SK-mel-23 cells from Professor V. Cerundolo, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. Cultures were maintained in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium with 10% foetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Both cell lines were negative for mycoplasma (MycoAlert kit, Lonza Rockland Inc., Rockland, USA), and were authenticated by STR genotyping (Eurofins Medigenomix Forensik GmbH). Selumetinib and trametinib (Selleck) were stored as 10mM solutions in DMSO at 80°C.
Cells were incubated with drugs for 60150min before harvesting for western blotting as previously described, using antibodies to DUSP4 (¯5149, Cell Signaling Technology (CST)), phospho-T202/Y204 ERK 1/2 (¯4377, CST), total ERK 1/2 (¯4695, CST), -tubulin (T4026, Sigma) and actin (A3854, Sigma). For clonogenic survival assays, drugs or vehicle control were added 24h after seeding, and cells incubated in the presence of drug for 714 days.
Cells were reverse transfected with 50nM gene-specific or non-silencing Allstars (Qiagen) siRNA on day 1 using Dharmafect 1 (ThermoFisher), forward transfected with 50nM siRNA on day 2 and re-seeded on day 3 for clonogenic assays. DUSP4 was depleted using siDUSP4_1 (¯4392420-s4372, Ambion) and siDUSP4_2 (J-003963-09, Dharmacon) and ETV4 using siETV4_1 and _2 (¯106636 and ¯106637, Thermofisher).
RNAs were extracted using the ReliaprepTM RNA miniprep kit (Promega) and reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix (ThermoFisher). PCRs were performed on a 7500 Fast RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR mastermix (ThermoFisher) with the following primers: DUSP4 forward, 5-GGGGTCCTGTGGAGATCCTT-3 and reverse, 5-GGCAGTCCGAGGAGACATTC-3; ETV4 forward 5-GAGCGGAGGATGAAAGCCG-3 and reverse 5-CCCATTTCCGGGCGATTTG-3; TUBA6 (housekeeping gene) forward 5-CCCCTTCAAGTTCTAGTCATGC-3 and reverse 5-ATTGCCAATCTGGACACCA-3.
The KaplanMeier method was used to obtain PFS and OS estimates by mutation status. As reported previously, the impact of NRAS mutation status was assessed by adding an interaction term with treatment in the Cox model, adjusting for stratification variables and using a significance level of 0.05. Correlations between tumour mutation results, gene signature scores and clinical outcomes were analysed using Microsoft Excel, with significance determined using t tests with a one-tailed distribution. NRAS VAF was compared with gene signature scores using Pearsons correlation coefficient. Western blot and cell survival data were analysed using GraphPad Prism v5, using t tests to compare two groups and ANOVA for multiple groups in each case with a two-tailed distribution.
