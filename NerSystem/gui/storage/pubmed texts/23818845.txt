HCV acutely infected subjects were recruited among high-risk HCV-seronegative IDUs participating in the Montreal Hepatitis C Cohort (HEPCO) at St. Luc hospital of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit© de Montr©al as previously described. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (SL05.014). All participants signed informed consent forms upon enrolment and experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were followed at scheduled 3-month intervals with a maximum duration of 22 weeks between visits. Acute infection was defined as either (i) detection of positive HCV RNA in the absence of HCV antibodies, followed by sero-conversion; (ii) a positive HCV antibody test following a previous negative test in the presence of positive HCV RNA; or (iii) a positive HCV antibody and RNA test within 3 months of a high-risk exposure. All patients tested negative for HIV and HBV. The estimated time of infection at recruitment was defined as the median time (in weeks) between the last negative test and first positive HCV RNA or antibody test. Spontaneous viral resolution (SR, n=13) or chronic infection (CI, n=24) was defined as the absence or the presence of HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-estimated time of infection (PEI), respectively. Two time points were studied for acutely infected patients: early acute (10 wks1 wk PEI) and late acute (30 weeks6 weeks PEI). Two additional categories of patients were studied: long-term HCV spontaneous resolvers (R) (n=8), defined as HCV RNA negative and antibody positive at two consecutive tests >60 days apart, and long-term HCV chronically infected patients (C) (n=27), defined as HCV RNA and antibody positive at recruitment with no prior negative test data. Healthy controls (n=18) were also studied. The characteristics and demographics of the study participants are summarized in Table 1. HLA typing was performed as previously described.
Qualitative HCV RNA tests were performed using an automated COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS Amplicor HCV test, version 2.0 (sensitivity, 50 IU/ml) (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc, Branchburg, NJ). HCV genotyping was done using standard sequencing for the NS5B region. Both tests were performed by the Laboratoire de Sant© Publique du Qu©bec (St.-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada) as part of the clinical follow- up of patients.
The concentrations of IL-17A and IL-21 were determined in plasma samples collected in EDTA and culture supernatants using commercial ELISA kits (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocols. The lower detection limits of the kits are 4 and 31 pg/ml, respectively. The concentration of Gal-9 in plasma was determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Uscn Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The lower detection limit of the kit is 7.8 pg/ml.
Peptides were synthesized by Sheldon biotechnology Centre, McGill University, (Montreal, QC, Canada). MHC class I tetramers were synthesized by either the National Immune Monitoring Laboratory (NIML) (Montr©al, QC, Canada) or the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA) and are as follows: HLA-A1-restricted HCV NS3 peptide aa 1436 to 1444 (ATDALMTGY) (A1/NS3-1436), HLA-A2-restricted HCV NS3 peptide aa 1073 to 1081 (CINGVCWTV) (A2/NS3-1073), HLA-A2-restricted HCV NS3 peptide aa 1406 to 1415 (KLVALGINAV) (A2/NS3-1406), HLA-A2-restricted HCV NS5b peptide aa 2594 to 1415 (A2/NS5b-2594), HLA-B7-restricted HCV core peptide aa 41 to 49 (GPRLGVRAT) (B7/core-41), HLA-B8-restricted HCV NS3 peptide aa 1395 to 1403 (HSKKKCDEL) (B8/NS3-1395) and HLA-B27-restricted HCV NS5b peptide aa 2841 to 2849 (ARMILMTHF) (B27/NS5b-2841).

Live cells were identified using Aqua Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON). Fluorescence minus one control stains were used to determine background levels of staining. Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed using a standard BD LSR II instrument equipped with blue (488 nm), red (633 nm), and violet (405 nm) lasers (BD Biosciences,) to systematically perform 11-9 color staining using the FACSDiva software (Version 5.0.3) (BD Biosciences). Compensation was performed with single fluorochromes and BD CompBeads (BD Biosciences). Biexponential transformation was applied during the analysis of data files using FlowJo software, version 9.4.11 for Mac (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).
Tregs were isolated using CD25 Microbeads II (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA) and the purity was assessed by flow cytometry. CD4 T cells were purified by negative selection using a CD4 T Cell Isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All sorts were performed using the FACS Aria II Instrument (BD Biosciences) employing FACSDiva software (Version 5.0.3). For Th17 progenitor cells, purified CD4 T cells were labeled and sorted according to viability and the expression of CD3, CD4, CD127, CD161, CCR6 and CD26. CD127low Tregs were excluded from the sort by gating on CD127high CD4 T cells. Two populations were collected: CD127highCD161neg or CD127highCD161highCCR6hiCD26hi CD4 T cells. Sorted cells were stimulated for 48 hours with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 before mRNA extraction and RT-PCR. For the purification of Tregs, CD4 T cells were isolated, labeled and sorted according to viability and the expression of CD3, CD4, CD127, CD25 and CD39. Three populations were collected: effector T cells (CD25negCD127hi), CD39+ Tregs (CD127lowCD25highCD39+) and CD39neg Tregs (CD127lowCD25highCD39neg). Sorted cells were washed, and immediately lysed to extract mRNA as described below or fixed using a Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBiosciences) to perform the intracellular staining of FoxP3 and CTLA-4, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All flow cytometry assays were performed on cryo-preserved samples. For the phenotype analysis, 2106 PBMCs were stained with freshly prepared tetramer-PE for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1 phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 1% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 0.02% NaN3). Samples were then stained with surface antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed twice in FACS buffer, and fixed in FACS Fix buffer (1 PBS, 1% formaldehyde).
Cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (50 ng/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively). Following 2 hours of stimulation, 5 µg/ml of brefeldin A and 5 µg/ml of monensin sodium salt were added, and cells were incubated for a total of 16 hours. Cells were washed with FACS buffer, stained for viability and cell surface antigens, fixed and permeabilized using a FoxP3 buffer solution (eBioscience). Then, the cells were stained with anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-21 and anti-IFN- antibodies for 30 minutes and washed twice in Perm buffer (eBioscience). For the analysis, cells were gated on viable CD3+ CD8 T cells.
CD25-depleted PBMCs were re-suspended in PBS at 20106 cells/ml and stained with 0.5 µM CFSE (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) for 8 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with human serum. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then re-suspended at 2106 cells/ml in warm RPMI (Life Technologies), 10% FCS (R-10) medium. CFSE-labeled cells were stimulated for 6 days with or without 1 µg/ml of the HCV-recombinant proteins NS3 and NS4 (Feldan, Quebec, QC, Canada) in the presence of 200 ng/ml of anti-CD28/-CD49d (Fastimmune, BD bioscience) at 37°C and 5% CO2. Recombinant human IL-2 (20 IU/ml) (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Germantown, MD) was added on day 3. Some assays were performed in the presence of blocking antibodies against PD-L1 (clone MIH1, eBioscience), CTLA-4 (Clone BNI3, BD biosciences) and Tim-3 (Clone F38-2E2, Biolegend) at 10 µg/ml each or in the presence of IgG1 and IgG2a isotype control antibodies. On day 6, cells were directly stained with surface antigens as described above or stimulated by PMA/ionomycin to assess cytokine secretion by HCV-specific T cells, identified by CFSElow expression.
PBMCs were stimulated with 10 µg/ml of the cognate HCV peptide for 6 days in the presence or absence of IL-21 (20 ng/ml). HCV-specific cells were identified as HCV tetramer+CD8+ T cells. Fold expansion was calculated by dividing the frequency of HCV tetramer+CD8+ T cells after in vitro expansion by the frequency measured directly ex vivo. 
PBMCs were incubated for 4 hours with varying concentrations of Gal-9 or Gal-3 (1 µM each) in R-10. Cells were then stained for surface markers and the specific HCV-tetramers followed by Annexin V staining using Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD biosciences). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with FoxP3 specific buffer (eBioscience) followed by intracellular staining with the anti-caspase-3 antibody.
Total RNA was extracted using Real-Time Ready Cell Lysis kit (Roche, Laval, QC, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using Transcriptor Universal cDNA Master (Roche). Real-time PCR amplification was performed using commercial primers (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada) for RORc (Assay ID QT00097888, Gene bank accession number NM_005060) or c-MAF (QT00023618, NM_005360) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in combination with the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). Transcription factor gene expression was quantified with the Advanced Relative Quantification method provided by the manufacturer and normalized with 28S mRNA expression. Quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 detection system (Roche).
Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above. Real-time PCR amplification was performed using the pre-developed assay-on-demand gene expression set for the Gal-9 gene (LGALS9) (Assay ID Hs00247135_m1, Gene bank accession number NM_009587.2, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the Human 18S endogenous control (HS_99999901, Gene bank accession number X03205.1, Applied Biosystems) using the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix. The quantification of Gal-9 mRNA expression was calculated with the absolute method provided by the manufacturer and expressed in Tregs relative to the expression in CD127hiCD25neg effector T cells. Quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 detection system (Roche).
For the silencing of LGALS9, we performed RNA interference experiments on isolated Treg cells according to the manufacturer's protocol by using Silencer siRNA Transfection II Kit (Ambion, Applied Biosystems). Knockdown of LGALS9 in Treg cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Control Treg cells received a scrambled siRNA. Cells were allowed to recover in R-10 complete media (RPMI, 10% FCS) at 37°C for 5 hours then used in the co-culture assay.
The combined CFSE/ICS assays were performed as described above in the presence of Tregs added at a ratio of 14 (TregsCD25-depleted CFSE labeled PBMCs). The percentage inhibition of cytokine production upon addition of Tregs to the stimulated PBMC cultures was calculated using the following formula: (percentage CFSElow cytokine+CD8neg T cells in absence of Tregs  percentage CFSElow cytokine+CD8neg T cells in presence of Tregs)/percentage CFSElow cytokine+CD8neg T cells in absence of Tregs100.
All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The Mann-Whitney U rank sum test was performed to compare the median values between two groups. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the median values between two paired groups. Correlations were determined by the Spearman rank test. P-values<0.05 were considered significant.
