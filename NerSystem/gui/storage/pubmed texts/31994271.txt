From March 2008 to December 2010, 256 patients with locally advanced OSCC from a prospective, randomized phase 3 trial (registration ID: NCT01542931) at the Ninth Peoples Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China) were enrolled in the present study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ninth Peoples Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Approval Number: 201618, Shanghai, China), and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Tumor samples were used for immunohistochemical staining against stathmin. Briefly, the sample sections were heated in a water bath at 100°C with a citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0) for 20 minutes to retrieve antigen. The primary antibodies included stathmin (#ab52630, 1:500 dilution; Abcam), Ki67 (#199721AP, 1:50 dilution; Proteintech) and Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1, #133301AP, 1:100 dilution; Proteintech). Stathmin immunohistochemical staining score was evaluated as previously described.12 
For the cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded in 96well plates (2  103 cells per well, three replicates). After cell adherence, a CCK8 kit was used to calculate cell viability at various time points.
For the cell cycle and apoptotic assay, cells were treated with solvent, BKM120 (5 mol L1), docetaxel (1.5 ng/mL), cisplatin (2 g/mL), 5fluorouracil (1 g/mL), or a combination of BKM120 and docetaxel/cisplatin/5fluorouracil (dosage as above) for 48 hours. Cells were washed with cold PBS twice and then fixed in 70% ethanol for 4 hours. Then the staining was performed by using the PI/RNase staining kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturers protocol and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
Apoptotic assay was analyzed using the FITCAnnexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturers protocol. Then the apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry and FlowJo software.
Patient, tissue sample, cell line, cell culture and immunofluorescence analyses, stathmin RNA interference and gene transfection, realtime PCR and western blotting were performed as previously described 7, 12 (Supplementary Methods).
Thirtysix male SPF BALB/c nude mice (nu/nu) were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and housed under pathogenfree conditions in the Animal Care Facilities at the Ninth Peoples Hospital. All mice are 5 weeks old and weighing approximately 20 g. Animal body weight was measured every 3 days. Mice were killed using asphyxiation by CO2 when they showed a 15% reduction from initial body weight or the diameter of grafts exceeded 1.5 cm. All in vivo experiments in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ninth Peoples Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Approval Number: 201618, Shanghai, China).
After lentivirus transfection with sistathmin and scramble control, 2  106 HN13 cells were injected subcutaneously to establish a xenograft model (n = 6 mice per group). When tumor volumes reached 50100 mm3, the mice were treated with TPbased chemotherapy (docetaxel and cisplatin). The dosage of drugs (based on our preliminary experiment results): docetaxel (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.] once a week), followed by cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg i.p. three times a week). Tumor size was measured every 7 days using the formula Volume = (Width2  Length)/2. Mice were killed on day 35 and three tumor samples from each group were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Routine paraffin sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
CAL27 cells showed relatively high stathmin expression,12 so this cell line was chosen to conduct followup experiments. A total of 2  106 CAL27 cells expressing firefly luciferase were injected subcutaneously into the right flank. After the tumor volumes reached 50100 mm3, mice were randomized to the following four groups (n = 6 mice per group): control; BKM120; TPF; and combination (BKM120 and TPF). Mice from four groups were treated, respectively, with vehicle, BKM120 (1.5 mg/kg, oral administration every other day), two cycles of TPF chemotherapy drugs (i.p. first cycle: docetaxel, 7.5 mg/kg; cisplatin, 7.5 mg/kg; 5fluorouracil, 15 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5fluorouracil, 15 mg/kg per day from days 2 to 5; the second cycle was administered from days 9 to 13), and BKM120 combined TPF chemotherapy drugs (dosage and administration method were as above). The dosage of drugs was determined from our preliminary experiment results. On the days of bioluminescence imaging, anesthesia was induced with inhalational 3%4% isoflurane in O2 (to avoid interference between anesthetic and luciferin if both were conducted through i.p.). Mice were then injected i.p. with 80 mg/kg Dluciferin (Gold Biotechnology) dissolved in sterile saline. Bioluminescence imaging was obtained 15 minutes later using the IVIS Lumina III In Vivo Imaging System (PerkinElmer). All images of tumorbearing mice were obtained in identical imaging conditions. Imaging was performed every 67 days after initiation of treatment. Mice were killed on day 25; three tumor samples from each group were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin, then routine paraffin sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Another three tumor samples from each group were lysed for western blot.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 6 Demo (GraphPad Software) and SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS). Posthoc power calculations were obtained using G*Power 3.1.9.4. Mean values were reported as the mean  standard deviation. All hypothesisgenerating tests were twosided at a significance level of 0.05. The statistical significance of differences between two groups was analyzed using Student t tests. The statistical significance of differences among groups was tested using oneway analysis of variance. The survival analysis was conducted using the KaplanMeier method and the logrank test. The efficacy analysis was conducted using the intentiontotreat principle.
