The potential of tenapanor to inhibit various CYPs was assessed by studying its interactions with CYP model substrates.
Reversible inhibition was assessed in triplicate by coincubation of tenapanor at 6 concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, and 30 M) with BD Gentest UltraPool 150 donor human liver microsomes (all from the same liver pool, lot no. 38289; BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) in the presence of CYP enzyme marker substrates and NADPH (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK), followed by monitoring of the rate of formation of CYP isoformspecific metabolites. Enzyme marker substrates, at or below their KM (the concentration of substrate that permits the enzyme to achieve half the maximum rate of reaction) were assessed in 2 mixtures: the first, assessed by AstraZeneca and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C, contained 80 M bupropion (for CYP2B6), 2 M amodiaquine (for CYP2C8), and 25 M nifedipine (for CYP3A4/5) (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK); the second, assessed by Pharmaron (Beijing, China) and incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C, contained 30 M phenacetin (for CYP1A2; Jince Analysis Technology Co Ltd, Tianjin, China), 10 M diclofenac (for CYP2C9; Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 35 M (S)mephenytoin (for CYP2C19; Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada), 5 M bufuralol (for CYP2D6; Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai, China), and 3 M midazolam (for CYP3A4/5; International Laboratory USA, South San Francisco, California). CYP isoformselective reversible inhibitors were used as positive controls: thiotepa (0.3100 M), quercetin (0.6200 M), ketoconazole (0.0010.5 M), naphthoflavone (0.00170.5 M), sulfaphenazole (0.03310 M), benzylnirvanol (0.05516.7 M), and quinidine (0.00170.5 M) (all from Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK).
The formation of CYP isoformspecific metabolites was measured under linear conditions for time and protein concentration. Following substrate incubation, the reaction was quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid (containing 40 nM verapamil internal standard; Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was analyzed for the concentrations of marker substrates by highperformance liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometric detection using a Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source in the multiple reactionmonitoring (MRM) mode. Chromatography was performed using an ACE C18AR 75  2.1 mm (particle size 3 m) or Thermo Scientific Hypersil Gold C18 50  2.0 mm (particle size 1.6 m) column maintained at 50°C, using a gradient of 20% to 95% acetonitrile in water (0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phase. The MRM transitions for each metabolite were: hydroxybupropion, m/z 257.05 > 239.126; desethylamodiaquine, m/z 328.972 > 284.027; oxidized nifedipine, m/z 345.176 > 284.013; paracetamol, m/z 152.3 > 110.2; 4OHdiclofenac, m/z 312.0 > 266.0; 4OHmephenytoin, m/z 235.1 > 150.1; 1OHbufuralol, m/z 278.4 > 186.0; 1OHmidazolam, m/z 342.0 > 203.0; and m/z 455.2 > 303.1 for the verapamil internal standard.
Inhibition of each CYP isoform was measured as the percentage decrease in the activity of marker metabolite formation compared to noninhibited (dimethyl sulfoxide) controls. The mean of the enzyme activity (% of control) was plotted against the log of the inhibitor concentration and fitted to an IC50 (concentration required to inhibit metabolite formation by 50%) curve using Prism 5.0 (Graphpad, California). Representative IC50 curves for hydroxybupropion (CYP2B6) and oxidized nifedipine (CYP3A4/5) are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. A result of no inhibition was quoted if none was observed at the highest concentration tested (P < .05), based on a Student ttest (test array = 100, 2 degrees of freedom, 2sample unequal equivalence). If inhibition was only observed at the highest concentration (P < .05), the IC50 was quoted as >30 M.
Induction of CYP mRNA expression by tenapanor in vitro was assessed by Xenoblis (SaintGr©goire, France). The potential of tenapanor to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 was investigated by measurement of mRNA levels after incubation of human HepaRG cell line cultures (Biopredic International, Rennes, France) with tenapanor at concentrations of 0.0001 to 50 M for 24 hours. In addition, HepaRG cell cultures were exposed for the same period to rifampicin (0.0220 M), omeprazole (0.2150 M), 6[4chlorophenyl]imidazo[2,1b][1,3]thiazole5carbaldehyde O[3,4dichlorobenzyl]oxime; 0.0011 M (CITCO), and phenobarbital (8.22000 M) (Sigma Aldrich, SaintQuentinFallavier, France) as positive controls, as well as to solvent vehicle controls. Four experiments were performed, each evaluating a range of tenapanor concentrations, with each concentration tested in triplicate.
CYP mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (Applied Biosystem 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR System, Life Technologies SAS, VillebonsurYvette, France) relative to GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, using SYBR Green validated primers for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4.18 CYP mRNA fold induction was calculated as the ratio between the mRNA expression of induced cells and control cells incubated with vehicle only.
Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years were eligible to participate in this study designed to evaluate the effect of tenapanor on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02140268). The key exclusion criteria were: history or presence of any condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs; use of drugs or substances with enzymeinducing properties within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug; loose stools (defined as a Bristol Stool Form Scale19 score of 6 or 7) for 2 or more days in the week before study drug administration; use of medications or supplements known to affect stool consistency and/or gastrointestinal motility, including fiber supplements, antidiarrheals, prokinetic drugs, enemas, probiotics, or salt or electrolyte supplements containing sodium, potassium, chloride, or bicarbonate formulations during the past 7 days before study drug administration. Women could not be pregnant, and if they were of childbearing potential, they were required to employ an effective method of contraception. Men were also required to use effective contraception.
All volunteers provided written informed consent. The protocol and informed consent form for this study were approved by MidLands Institutional Review Board (Overland Park, Kansas) before the study began. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation, and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
This was a phase 1, openlabel, fixedsequence study conducted at a single site in the United States (Quintiles, Overland Park, Kansas). The study consisted of a screening visit, 2 residential treatment periods with an intervening nonresidential period, and a followup visit (Figure 1).
All volunteers received a single oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg (syrup formulation) on day 1 (hereafter referred to as midazolam) followed by a tablet of tenapanor 15 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 15. On day 15, a single, oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg was taken together with the morning dose of tenapanor (hereafter referred to as midazolam + tenapanor). Volunteers were screened up to 4 weeks before day 1 (ie, the day before the first treatment period) and were then resident in the study center for days 1 and 1 before being discharged at the beginning of day 2. Midazolam was administered 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast on day 1. Days 2 through 13 were nonresidential, during which the volunteers were expected to take tenapanor twice daily just before breakfast and dinner. Volunteers returned to the study center for days 14 to 16; tenapanor was given twice daily just before breakfast and dinner on days 14 and 15, and midazolam was administered 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast on day 15. Volunteers were discharged from the study center on day 16 after all of the safety assessments and sample collections were complete and then visited the study center for followup 7 to 10 days after day 15.
Blood samples were taken predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 24 hours postdose for pharmacokinetic analysis of midazolam (and its 1OH and 4OH metabolites) on days 1 and 15. Blood samples for measurement of plasma tenapanor concentrations were collected on day 15 at predose and at 1, 2, and 4 hours postmorning dose. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory evaluations, and physical examinations.
The 7.5mg dose of midazolam was chosen because it is below the maximum permitted oral dose (1015 mg) to yield an exposure and sedation margin in healthy volunteers. The tenapanor dose of 15 mg twice daily was chosen because it lies within the dose range likely to be used in later clinical trials of the drug. Importantly, this dose was also intended to ensure that any effect of tenapanor on midazolam metabolism would be caused by CYP inhibition/induction and not by other effects previously observed with highdose tenapanor treatment, such as diarrhea (also undesirable in a healthy volunteer study).
Plasma concentrations of tenapanor were measured by Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, Wisconsin). Human plasma samples containing tenapanor and a deuteriumlabeled analogue of tenapanor (d8tenapanor) as the internal standard were processed by liquidliquid extraction. After evaporation under nitrogen, the reconstituted samples were injected and analyzed by reversedphase highperformance liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex Synergi HydroRP 75  2.0 mm (particle size 4 m) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, California) maintained at 35°C, with a gradient of 31% to 60% acetonitrile in water (0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phase. The extract was nebulized using heated nitrogen in electrospray positive ionization mode (Sciex API 5500, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). The ionized compounds were detected using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (MRM transitions: tenapanor, m/z 573.0 > 502.1; d8tenapanor, m/z 577.4 > 504.0). The lower and upper limits of quantification were 0.5 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL, respectively, using a 100L aliquot of human K2EDTA plasma. The accuracy and precision of qualitycontrol standards of tenapanor were determined at concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, 12, and 75 ng/mL. Interrun accuracy and precision were in the ranges of 100.1% to 109.2% and 3.3% to 7.7%, respectively.
Samples for determination of midazolam, 1OHmidazolam, and 4OHmidazolam concentration in plasma were analyzed by Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, Wisconsin). Midazolam, 1OHmidazolam, 4OHmidazolam, and the deuterated internal standards were extracted from samples using liquidliquid extraction. After evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analyzed by reversedphase highperformance liquid chromatography using a Waters Xbridge C18 50  2.1 mm (particle size 5 m) column (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts) maintained at 30°C, using a gradient of 45% to 95% methanol in 30 mM ammonium formate (0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phase. The extract was nebulized using heated nitrogen in electrospray positive ionization mode, and the ionized compounds were detected by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (MRM transitions: midazolam, m/z 326.3 > 291.3; 1OHmidazolam, m/z 342.2 > 203.1; 4OHmidazolam, m/z 342.2 > 234.2; d4midazolam, m/z 330.3 > 295.1; d41OHmidazolam, m/z 346.3 > 203.1). The lower and upper limits of quantification were 0.1 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL, respectively, using a 100L aliquot of human K2EDTA plasma. The accuracy and precision of qualitycontrol standards of midazolam, 1OHmidazolam, and 4OHmidazolam were determined at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 5, and 75 ng/mL. Interrun accuracy and precision were in the ranges of 95.3% to 106.0% and 2.2% to 12.4%, respectively.
The bioanalytical methods were validated prior to sample analysis, and all study samples were analyzed within the known stability period of 278 days (tenapanor) or 150 days (midazolam and its metabolites). At a minimum, each analytical run included a calibration curve, a matrix blank, a control 0 sample (matrix blank containing internal standard), a reagent blank, and duplicate quality control samples at 3 concentrations within the calibration range. Both methods also demonstrated selectivity in the presence of coadministered drug.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived for midazolam and its metabolites on days 1 and 15 using standard noncompartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 (Certara, St. Louis, Missouri). The pharmacokinetic parameters determined were as follows: the maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax); the area under the concentrationtime curve in plasma from time 0 (predose) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0t), calculated by linear up/log down trapezoidal summation; the area under the concentrationtime curve in plasma from time 0 (predose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC), calculated by linear up/log down trapezoidal summation and extrapolated to infinity by addition of the last quantifiable concentration (Ct) divided by the apparent elimination rate constant (»z; ie, AUC = AUC0t + Ct/»z).
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Cary, North Carolina) software, version 9.4. Natural log transformations of Cmax, AUC, and AUC0t for midazolam and its metabolites were separately analyzed using a mixedeffects analysis of variance model, with a fixed effect for treatment and random effect for participant. The point estimate and 90%CI for the difference between treatments (midazolam + tenapanor and midazolam alone) were constructed. The point estimate and 90%CIs were then exponentially backtransformed to provide point and CI estimates for the ratio of interest ([midazolam + tenapanor]/midazolam alone).
If there were no influence of tenapanor on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a standard deviation of at most 0.5 for the change in logtransformed pharmacokinetic variables, and evaluable data from 24 participants, the probability of a 2sided 90%CI for the ratio of (midazolam + tenapanor)/midazolam completely contained within 70% to 143% was 90%. Therefore, up to 28 volunteers were required to be enrolled in order to obtain 24 evaluable participants.
