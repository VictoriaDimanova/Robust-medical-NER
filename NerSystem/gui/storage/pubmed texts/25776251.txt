The clinical trial was approved by the RVC's Ethics and Welfare Committee (ASPA number 70/7393) and conducted between June 2010 and May 2013. The synbiotic used contained 1  109 cfu EF NCIMB 10415 E1707, FOS and gum Arabic1. The placebo consisted of an identical capsule containing maltodextran.
Dogs with a history typical for chronic enteropathy (¥3 weeks of vomiting, diarrhea or both, with or without weight loss) were included. The diagnosis of chronic enteropathy was confirmed based on established criteria (no clinically relevant abnormalities on routine hematology, serum biochemistry; trypsinlike immunoreactivity [TLI], canine pancreatic lipase [cPL] and adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]stimulation test results within the reference range; no abnormalities on abdominal imaging [radiographs, abdominal ultrasound examination or both]). Histopathologic findings of intestinal mucosal biopsies had to show lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic or mixed inflammation with or without architectural changes.20, 21 Exclusion criteria were the presence of concurrent diseases or treatment with antimicrobials, antiinflammatory drugs or both 7 days before presentation.
Dogs were seen at three separate visits: visit 1 (recruitment), visit 2 (14  3 days after starting the trial medication) and visit 3 (42  3 days after starting the trial medication; see Fig 1). The procedures performed at each visit are listed in Table 1. Patients were randomized (using random permutated blocks of n = 12 that had been designed before the start of the study2) to receive either the synbiotic EF product or placebo in conjunction with a hydrolyzed protein diet3. All members of staff involved in the trial (apart from the study monitor, a head nurse) were blinded to the dogs' medications.
Clinical severity was assessed using the CCECAI at all three visits.1 
Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed in all dogs according to standard procedures. Macroscopic endoscopic scoring was performed using the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) approved endoscopic examination report.20 Multiple biopsies (1520) from the duodenum and colon were taken with a singleuse endoscopic biopsy forceps, and 1015 from each site were transferred immediately into 2% neutralbuffered formalin. The remaining biopsies (minimum of 2) were transferred to RNAlater4 , stored at 4°C for 24 h and then at 80°C until further processing.
Initial histopathological assessment was performed at the pathology department of the RVC as part of the routine diagnostic procedure. After finalizing the study, all slides were reviewed by 1 of the authors (HB), and WSAVA standardized classification was applied to all slides.20, 21 As described previously,22 9 histologic variables, five representing morphological changes and four representing inflammatory changes were scored as absent = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3 according to the WSAVA guidelines.20, 21 The total histology score was recorded. At this stage of histologic analysis, HB was blinded to original diagnosis, visit number and treatment group.
A single biopsy stored in RNAlater was thawed and homogenized in lysis buffer5 using 5 mm stainless steel beads5 and a tissue grinder6. Total RNA was extracted using a commercial kit7 including an oncolumn DNAse treatment, and eluted in 30 L nucleasefree water. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using an automated analyzer8. Reverse transcription of 1 g of RNA was performed with a cDNA synthesis kit9, which uses a mixture of oligodT and random nonamer primers.
Canine sequences for the genes of interest and reference genes were cloned as described before.23 Primers were designed based on publically available gene sequences (Genbank, ENSEMBL) using the Primer3 software (see Table 2).24 A total of 16 genes were assessed for stability using suitable software10 with a commercially available canine reference gene array11. Based on these data, four reference genes were selected for canine duodenum and five for the colon, respectively (Table 2). Primers were optimized using standard PCR12. Amplicons were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified13 and cloned into a holding vector14 for subsequent sequencing15 and for qPCR standards (see below).
qPCR reactions were carried out in triplicate at a total reaction volume of 20 L, using a commercially available reagent mix16 and a primer concentration of 200 nM. Cycling steps were: 95°C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 10 s, 72°C for 10 s and 80°C for 5 s. Reaction efficiency was determined using 10fold dilutions (107 molecules L1 to 101 molecules L1) of plasmids containing the cloned amplicon. Melting curves were generated to ensure a single amplicon had been produced. Averaged gene expression data for each sample were normalized against the geometric mean of the reference genes.25 
Several genes of the innate immune system interacting with bacteria (Tolllike receptors26, 27 [TLRs] 2,4,5, and 9 as well as components of the inflammasome,28 NLRP3, casp1, interleukin [IL]1 and IL18) and the adaptive immune response in the intestine were investigated. For the latter, several signature cytokines and transcription factors of different T helper lymphocyte (Th) cell lines were assessed. These included Th17 cells (IL17A, IL22, IL23p40, RORC),29, 30 Th1 cells (IL12p35, IL2, TNF), Th2 cells (IFN and IL4,31 and Tregs (IL10 and TGF).32 
Expression of the socalled trefoil factors (TFF), genes associated with epithelial barrier function and repair,33 also was assessed. The nuclear receptor PPAR, usually responsible for blocking the transcription of inflammatory cytokines34 and supposedly especially upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells by enterococci,35 was investigated additionally.
To facilitate visualization of gene expression data and changes in gene expression among visits of the clinical trial, heatmaps were created using a statistical package17.
Clinical severity (as assessed by CCECAI) was selected as the primary outcome measure. Calculations were based on a type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.1, which corresponds to a power of 90%. When assuming a difference (delta, ) of 1.5 times the sd (Ï) to be medically relevant, the necessary number of animals in each group (treatment versus placebo) was determined to be n = 11.
Statistical analysis was performed using 2 commercially available software packages18 , 19. Normal distribution was assessed by inspection of histograms or D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Subsequently, either parametric or nonparametric tests were performed: A repeated measures model was used to assess the effect of the treatment interval (before versus after 6 weeks of treatment) and treatment type (EF versus placebo). KruskalWallis or ttests were performed to compare clinical and clinicopathological data, endoscopy and histology scores on visit 1 between treatment groups. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
