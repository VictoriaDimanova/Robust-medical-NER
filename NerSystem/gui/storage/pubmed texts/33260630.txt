A total of 88 B-ALL patients referred from six Spanish centres to the Molecular Biology Unit at La Princesa University Hospital, Spain, between January 2013 and December 2015 were eligible for this study. Sixty-seven patients were children (76.14%, <18 years) and 21 were adults (23.86%, >18 years). The diagnosis of B-ALL was based on morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of leukaemic blast cells, as described previously.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or from legal guardians before patients entered the study in all hospitals involved. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of La Princesa University Hospital (approval ID: PI-655) on 7 November 2012.
Amplicon-based NGS was performed on 62 samples obtained from untreated patients at diagnosis (54 patients were children (87.10%, <18 years) and eight were adults (12.90%, >18 years) and five B-cell lines (Granta-519 and Jeko1: leukaemic transformation of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); Ramos: Burkitts lymphoma; Mino: MCL and REH: B-ALL) from ATCC. Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow samples with the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturers instructions. An amplicon-based NGS assay was performed with 45 amplicons ranging from 275 to 144 bp (AmpliSeq; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) covering the exon and flanking intron regions of TYK2 (RefSeq: NM_003331.4) with an overall coverage of 93.98%, using the Ion Torrent Sequencing Platform (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK) (Table S1). Data were validated by Sanger using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems) or PGM Sequencing Platform (Applied Biosystem, Cheshire, UK). Amplicon library pooling, purification, emulsion PCR, sequencing, validation of variants, data processing, and analysis was performed as previously described. The novel variant S431G was annotated in GeneBank (BankIt2289375 ENST00000525621.6 MN842724).
TYK2 variants were obtained by oligonucleotide-mediated site-direct mutagenesis (ThermoFisher Scientific) of wild-type TYK2 cloned in the pRc-CMVneo eukaryotic expression vector (pRc-Tyk2) provided by Dr. Pellegrini (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and the final constructs were sequenced. The control variants pRc-TYK2 K930R (kinase dead) and pRc-TYK2 V678F (catalytically hyperactive) were also provided by Dr. Pellegrini, together with the 293T and TYK2-deficient, IFN-unresponsive human fibrosarcoma 11,1 cells (also called U1A). The recessive mutant 11,1 (U1A) was obtained from the parental 2fTGH cell line, derived by genetic approach to isolate regulatory mutations in the IFN signalling pathway. Mycoplasma free 293T and U1A cells were grown in Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific) containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS). Transfection of pRc-TYK2 mutants was performed with FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) following the manufacturer´s instructions. Final, stable TYK2-expressing clones were selected in 400 g/mL of Geneticin G418, and resistant colonies were ring-cloned two weeks later and expanded.
Cells were starved for 2 h in serum-free DMEM before IFN2b stimulation for 15 min with concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 pM (Immunotools GmbH; Friesoythe, Germany). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer using a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific). Protein content was determined by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and 30 g was separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, analysed by Western blot and revealed using ECL detection reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific). For re-probing, blots were stripped with Restore plus Western blot stripping buffer (Cultek, Madrid, Spain) for 10 min at room temperature. The following Abs were used: anti phospho (p)-STAT1 (Y701), anti pSTAT2 (Y690), anti p-STAT3 (Y705), anti p-TYK2 (YY1054/55), directed to the activation loop tyrosine (Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly, CA, USA), anti TYK2 mAb T10-2 (Hybridolab, Institut Pasteur, kindly gifted by Dr. S. Pellegrini) raised against a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 289451 of human TYK2, anti STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and anti Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
An in vitro kinase assay was performed as described. Briefly, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM EDTA in presence of protease inhibitors. TYK2 was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg lysate using non-commercial R5-9 polyclonal Ab (a gift from S. Pellegrini, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and 40 L protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with slow rotation at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in buffer 1 (50 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 400 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA), once in buffer 2 (50 mM Tris (pH 6.8) and 200 mM NaCl), and once in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) and 10 mM MgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out in kinase buffer, in the presence of 0.06 g of recombinant (r) STAT3 (SignalChem Lifesciences Corporation, British Columbia, Canada), and with or without 30 M ATP at 30 °C for 5 min in a total volume of 30 L. The reaction was finished by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Half of the sample was loaded for SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphorylated products were analysed by Western blotting.
For TYK2 expression analysis, 88 B-ALL patients were compared to 105 healthy donors. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using Superscript R Vilo TM cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) with 1 g total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated by Ficoll from 10 mL of peripheral blood, in the case of healthy donors, or bone marrow at diagnosis, in the case of patients, using Ultraspec (Biotecx, Houston, TX, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) samples were diluted 1:10 before amplification by qPCR using TaqMan Fast-Advanced MMix (Applied Biosystems) in a CFX384 Real-Time System (Roche Diagnostics). The following TaqMan assays were used: Hs00177464_m1 (TYK2), Hs03929097_g1 (GAPDH) (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturers protocols. For each sample, relative mRNA levels were determined using the comparative Ct (Ct) method (normalised to GAPDH). In the case of U1A transfected cells, different clones were incubated 1 and 3 h with 500 pM of IFN after 2 h of serum starvation, and total RNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed as detailed above. TaqMan assays used were Hs00971965_m1 for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), Hs00973635_m1 for 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), Hs02330328_s1 for suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), and Hs01065498_m1 for serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim-1 (PIM1) (ThermoFisher Scientific).
The crystallographic data of human TYK2 and the structural complexes were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4PO6). Visualization, structural analysis of the protein and the in silico mutant were made with PyMOL. The TYK2 wild type (WT)IFNAR1, TYK2 R245HIFNAR1, and TYK2 S431GIFNAR1 complexes were verified, cleaned, and ordered with the pdb4amber scrip before starting the preparation in order to generate suitable topologies from the LEaP module of AMBER 19. Each structure and complex was subjected to the following protocol: hydrogens and other missing atoms were added using the LEaP module with the leaprc.protein.ff19SB parameter set, Cl or K+ counterions were added to neutralise the system, the complexes were then solvated in an octahedral box of explicit TIP3P model water molecules localising the box limits at 12  from the protein surface. All calculations were made using graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated molecular dynamic (MD) engine in AMBER (pmemd.cuda). The protocol consisted in performing a minimisation of the initial structure, followed by 50 ps heating and pressure equilibration at 315 K and 1.0 atm pressure, respectively. Finally, the system was equilibrated with 500 ps before starting the production of MD, which consisted of 50 ns for each complex. Frames were saved at 10 ps intervals for subsequent analysis. All analyses were done using CPPTRAJ and binding free energies calculated by molecular mechanics/PoissonBoltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA). The calculations of root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were made, considering C, CA, and N atoms.
When analysing STAT target genes expression, cell line intrinsic differences between time conditions were analysed by two-way ANOVA, performing post hoc Bonferroni tests for intergroup differences (* vs. 0 h from each TYK2 variant; # vs. wild type (WT)s same time condition. For * and #: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001). Differences in TYK2 expression between healthy controls and B-ALL patients were evaluated using the MannWhitney U test. Association between TYK2 expression and patient age was estimated using Spearman correlation (Ï). Prior to the correlation analysis, the ShapiroWilk test was performed. Overall survival (OS) curves were estimated by the KaplanMeier method, and the log-rank test or TaroneWare test. Overall survival risk by group was estimated using Cox regression. The Ï2 and Fishers exact two-sided tests were used for comparisons between categorical variables, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test or t test was used for continuous variables. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS program (Statistical Package for Social Sciences Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; version 22.0) and the version 6.05 of the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), also used for graphical representation.
