Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs, ScienCell, Cat. #6100, San Diego, CA) were cultured with endothelial cell medium (ECM, ScienCell, Cat. #100) and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ScienCell, Cat. #0025), 1% endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, ScienCell, Cat. #1052), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (P/S, ScienCell, Cat. #0503) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HAECs were cultured in fibronectin-precoated 6-well plates at a density of 7000cells/cm2 for 24hours in the presence of ox-LDL (80g/mL, Union-Biology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) or ox-LDL (80g/mL) following atorvastatin (0.05mol/L, Jialin Pharma Ltd, Beijing, China). Untreated HAECs were used as a negative control. Cells were serum-starved overnight before treatment. All samples were assayed in triplicate.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Cat. #15596-018, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was verified using a NanoDrop ND-20003.2 Spectrophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA was further purified by the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Cat. #74106, GmBH, Dusseldorf, Germany) and the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, Cat. #79254).
Total RNA was amplified and labeled by the Low Input Quick Amp WT Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat. #5190-2943), following the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cRNAs were purified by the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Cat. #74106).
Each slide was hybridized with 1.65g of Cy3-labeled cDNA using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat. #5188-5242) in a hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, Cat. #G2545A), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 17hours of hybridization, slides were washed in staining dishes (Thermo Shandon, Cat. #121, Waltham, MA) with Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat. #5188-5327), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Slides were scanned by an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Cat. #G2565CA) with the default settings: dye channel: green, scan resolution=3m, PMT 100%, and 20 bits. Data were extracted with Feature Extraction software 10.7 (Agilent Technologies). Raw data were normalized by the Quantile algorithm in the limma packages in R. LncRNA and mRNA microarray assays were performed by the Biotechnology Corporation (Shanghai, China).
Differentially expressed (DE) genes were selected by fold-change (fold change (linear)0.5 or fold change (linear)¥2) and Student t test (P-value<.05 or <.01) after normalization of raw data. A heatmap was used to display the gene expression levels in different samples by clustering the samples and genes. Gene Ontology (GO) adapted Fisher test, the cluster profiler packages in R/Bioconductor, and KEGG pathway analysis were used to analyze the functions of the genes in the pathway.
Cis: the genes located approximately 10kb either upstream or downstream of the lncRNA were considered possible target genes; Trans: the complementary sequences were aligned in Blast, the complementary energy between two sequences was calculated with RNA-plex, and then the genes with e30 were considered possible target genes.
To validate the results of the microarrays, 16 DE genes related to endothelial dysfunction were chosen for q-PCR, including 8 lncRNAs (lnc-C17orf81-4:4, lnc-TK1-2:1, lnc-KIAA0101-1:3, lnc-RP1-32I10.10.1-2:1, lnc-KLHL10-2:1, lnc-PKLR-1:1, lnc-LCNL1-2:1, and NONHSAT061051) and their corresponding target mRNAs (ACADVL, BIRC5, KIAA0101, KIAA1644, ACLY, FDPS, PTGDS, and ICAM1), which were related to endothelial dysfunction. Total RNA was isolated and q-PCR for lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed according to standard protocols. Complementary DNA was synthesized using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Cat. #04379012001, Germany), and q-PCR was performed by using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche, Cat. #04707516001), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a LightCycler480 instrument (Roche). The primer sequences are listed in Table 1 (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The data were calculated and presented by the 2Ct method.
