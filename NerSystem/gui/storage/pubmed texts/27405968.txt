Twenty nonobese (body mass index <30 kg/m2) older (¥60 years) males volunteered to participate in this study. Only men were included in this initial investigation to avoid the potential gender differences in muscle adaptations to RET in older adults (Bamman et al. 2003). All participants were free of overt chronic diseases by medical history and had obtained medical clearance from their personal physician prior to beginning the study. One participant was excluded due to initiation of steroid treatment after enrollment. Four individuals in the resistance exercise intervention were taking a statin (3 on Atorvastatin, 1 on simvastatin; 2040 mg OD) for at least a year without muscular complaints. All participants were sedentary to recreationally active and were free of orthopedic conditions that would preclude engaging in a resistance exercise intervention. Participants taking over the counter supplements, multivitamins, or aspirin completed a twoweek washout period prior to the first biopsy. The nature, purpose, risks, and benefits were explained to each subject before obtaining informed consent. The experimental protocols were approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board.
Subjects were randomized to 12week intervention consisting of supervised resistance exercise on three nonconsecutive days per week using machine exercises (Life Fitness, Rosemont, IL) or a waitlist control group. The resistance exercise protocol included three upper body exercises: chest press, shoulder press, and pulldown, and four lower body exercises: leg press, leg curl, leg extension, and plateloaded leg press.
Subjects performed one set of each exercise to volitional fatigue/failure (i.e., inability to complete another repetition) with the goal of performing 812 repetitions at a slow and controlled pace. The latter is consistent with current recommendations for RET in older adults (Garber et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2007). All participants were asked to maintain their habitual dietary intake and physical activity level during the intervention period. Compliance to this request was confirmed using 24h dietary recalls and accelerometry as described below. Muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and 48 h after the last resistance exercise session at 3 and 12 weeks of the intervention. The waitlist control group remained sedentary for a 12week period and had muscle biopsies at the same intervals. The control group was offered the resistance exercise intervention after completion of their participation in the study.
Upper body and leg strength were assessed at baseline and week 12 using a threerepetition max (3RM) test for chest press and leg press. The 3RM was defined as the maximal resistance that could be moved through the full range of motion for three repetitions. Subjects began with a warmup set of three repetitions and resistance was progressively increased in subsequent sets to a point where the subjects could not perform three repetitions.
Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale with participants wearing light street clothing and no shoes (ScaleTronix model 5002, Wheaton, IL). Height was measured in cm without shoes using a wallmounted stadiometer. Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm at the umbilicus using a Gulick tape measure (Gulick, Country Technology, Inc, Gays Mill, WI). Body composition was measured via dual energy Xray absorptiometry (GE Lunar Prodigy Advance, software version 8.10e, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI). Skeletal muscle mass index (Fielding et al. 2011) was calculated as described previously (Fielding et al. 2011). Participants wore an accelerometer (GT1M, ActiGraph, LLC, Pensacola, FL) for a 4day period at baseline and again at 12 weeks to determine physical activity level outside of the training protocol measured in steps per day. Subjects completed three 24h dietary recalls during the week of initial and followup testing. These were completed by a trained diet technician and included one weekend day and 2 weekdays. The dietary recalls were analyzed using NDSR version 2011 (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis MN).
Biopsies were obtained in the fasted state from the vastus lateralis muscle using a modified Bergstrmtype needle (Cadence, Staunton, VA) using suction (Marinik et al. 2013) at baseline, week 3, and week 12 for both the intervention and control groups. Samples were immediately placed in SET buffer (0.25 mol/L Sucrose, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.01 mol/L TrisHCl and 2 mmol/L ATP) and stored on ice until analysis within 30 min. Muscle used for mitochondrial isolation was placed in isolation buffer (100 mmol/L Kcl, 50 mmol/L MOPS. 1 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L ATP, pH 7.5; all from SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) and stored on ice until isolation. Muscle used for quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was placed in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen.
Pyruvate and palmitate oxidation rates were measured in the fresh muscle homogenates by counting the 14CO2 produced from [U14C] pyruvate and [114C] palmitic acid during incubation, respectively, as previously described (Hulver et al. 2003). The activity of CS, a biochemical marker of mitochondrial density and oxidative capacity (Blomstrand et al. 1997; Larsen et al. 2012) and HAD, a key regulatory enzyme in the beta oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl Co A, were determined spectrophotometrically in muscle homogenates as described previously (Heilbronn et al. 2005; Frisard et al. 2010).
RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit with DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRTPCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix used according to the manufacturer's specifications (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Gene expression of key transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorgamma coactivator1 alpha [PGC1] and transcription factor A, mitochondrial [TFAM]) and metabolism (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor delta) [PPAR´]) in skeletal muscle were normalized to cyclophilin B mRNA levels. Primers and 5# FAMlabeled TaqMan probes were purchased as previously validated assays (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification of target genes were calculated using the 2C T method. Derivation of the 2C T equation has been described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin no. 2 (P/N 4303859). All samples were run in triplicate.
Mitochondria were isolated and prepared as previously described with modifications (Bharadwaj et al. 2015). Briefly, the biopsy sample was homogenized using a dounce homogenizer and mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation. Mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the bicinchoninic acid assay (ThermoScientific, Pittsburg, PA).
Reactive oxygen species production at complex 1, complex III, and reverse flow of electrons in isolated mitochondria was measured using an Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay kits as previously described (Mcmillan et al. 2015). All experiments were performed at 37°C. Measures for ROS levels were conducted on a microplate reader (Biotek synergy 2, Winooski, VT). Fluorescence of Amplex Red was measured using a 530 nm excitation filter and a 560 nm emission filter.
MannWhitney U tests were performed to compare subject characteristics and changes in dependent variables between groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of treatment (resistance exercise vs. control), time, and treatment by time interaction on the dependent variables of interest. Because we have a small sample, these analyses were rerun with standard error estimates based on 1000 bootstrap samples to obtain biascorrected confidence intervals by repeated reestimations of the parameter estimates. There were no significant differences in any of the dependent variables between statin users and nonusers at baseline or following the resistance exercise intervention. In addition, the exclusion of statinusers from the analysis did not alter the conclusions of the study. As such, only the pooled data are presented. All data are presented as means  standard deviation. Significance level was set a prior at P < 0.05.
