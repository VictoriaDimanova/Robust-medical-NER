Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patient's material was collected between 20102012 at the Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Charit© University Hospital (CCCC) with coverage of the Tumor REsearch And Treatment  20 Patient Pilot (TREAT 20) project approved by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (No. 031 5852A). Tumor specimens were obtained at the time of surgery and spitted into equal pieces for paraffin-embedding and establishment of tumor-derived cell cultures. We received material sufficient for both procedures from 16 out of 20 patients.
All primary low passage melanoma cell strains and A375 cells were cultured in Quantum 263 medium (PAA, Austria) supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen) while MeWo cells were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2, 37°C and routinely passaged at 80% confluence. Medium was changed every 3 days. Human neonatal epidermal Melanocytes were cultured in Melanocyte growth medium (both Lonza). Phenotype shift experiments were done in hESC-medium with and without 4 ng/ml of FGF-2 (Biosource) or in Quantum 263 medium supplemented for 3 days with 10 ng/ml TGF2 (Miltenyi).
MACS separation into CD133+ and CD133 fractions was done with accordance to the manufacturer's instructions using the indirect CD133 MicroBead kit and LS columns (Miltenyi, Germany). Briefly, 80% confluent cells were washed with PBS and detached with Accutase (PAA, Austria) and adjusted up to 4107 cells per column and sorted with a modified PBS buffer containing 5% FBS (MACS buffer).
Cells were harvested using Accutase, pelleted at 1000 rpm and re-suspended in MACS buffer. 2.5105 cells were incubated either with human specific CD271-PE or CD271-APC antibody (Miltenyi, clone ME20.4-1.H4, mouse IgG1, 120), human specific CD133 antibody (Miltenyi, clone W6B3C1, mouse IgG1, 110,) or mouse IgG1 Isotype control (Miltenyi) at 4°C for 10 min. Washed cells were re-suspended in 500 µl PBS and stored on ice or labeled with a secondary antibody.

Reverse transcription of 500 ng2.5 µg RNA was performed with SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Germany) and diluted to a final volume of 50 µl. qRT-PCR was carried out on a Step one plus (Applied Biosystems, Germany) for 3040 cycles. Primers were designed for 5560°C annealing temperatures (Table S1). In qPCR expression levels were calculated either with CT or CT, normalized to -actin. PCR products (15 µl) were separated on a 2% agarose (BioRad) gel.
Briefly, a number of 11051106 cells was mixed with Matrigel (11) and subcutaneously injected in NSG mice (n=3/per group). Tumor volume given as [(tumor width)2  tumor length] 0.5 was measured with a caliper instrument and was monitored during the entire experiment with the measurements of two perpendicular tumor diameters.
All animal experiments were performed at the EPO GmbH, Berlin, Germany in accordance with the German Animal Protection Law and approved by the local responsible authorities (LAGeSo A0452/08). The in vivo procedures were consistent and in compliance with the UKCCCR guidelines.
FFPE material was sectioned to 2 µm after de-waxing, peroxidase blocking and antigen-retrieval using citrate buffer, pH 6.0. IHC for melanoma markers Melanosome (clone HMB45, mouse, 150, Dako); Tyrosinase (clone T311, mouse, 150, Novocastra); MITF (clones C5+D5, mouse, 125, Zytomed) and CD271 (clone D4B3, XP, rabbit, 1100, Cell signaling), as well as hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) was done with the Discovery XT biomarker platform (Ventana). For IF on tumor sections: sections were blocked in 5% goat serum at RT for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies: human specific CD133 (clone W6B3C1, mouse, 110, Miltenyi); CD133 (polyclonal, rabbit 1100, Biorbyt); CD271 (clone D4B3-XP, rabbit, 1100, Cell signaling) and MART-1 (Melan-A clone A103/M2-7C10/M2-9E3, 150, Zymed) diluted in 2% BSA/PBS.

For knock-down of CD271, melanoma cells were transfected with 2 µg of each shRNA plasmid (#2: 5-ACAACCTCATCCCTGTCTATT-3; #3: 5-CCCGAGCACATAGA CTCCTTT-3 and #4: 5-CCGAGCACATAGACTCCTTTA-3) or control shRNA (shCtl., 5-GGAATCTCATTCGATGCATAC-3; all from Qiagen) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were selected with puromycin (10 µg/ml) over a period of two weeks. For over-expression melanoma cells were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged human CD271 (RG207966, OriGene) and selected with G418 (300 µg/ml, PAA).
Whole genome expression profiling of CD271k.d. and shCtl. cells was performed with three biological replicates. Illumina raw data of BeadChip HumanHT-12V4 platform were summarized via the BeadStudio without normalization and background correction. Follow-up processing was done via the R/Bioconductor environment. The lumi package was used for data annotation. Following statistical tests, data were quantile normalized.
The microarray analysis data have been deposited to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE52456.
Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified by statistical tests using the bioconductor limma package. The significance in terms of the false discovery rate (FDR), the q-value, was determined by the q-value package applied to several statistical tests (Student's t-test, Welch test and Wilcoxon test). Genes were defined significantly differentially expressed when the average Affymetrix (MAS5) detection p-value of at least one case (treatment or control) was <0.05 and one of the p- values of statistical tests (Student's t-test, Welch test and Wilcoxon test) was <0.05. Genes with ratios >1.33 or <0.75 were defined as significantly up-regulated or down-regulates, respectively. Heat maps were generated using Spearman's rank correlation as similarity measure and complete linkage. Genes with a limma false discovery rate (FDR) below (0.005) were defined as highly significantly regulated. Using this criteria we found 123 genes comprising 68 down-regulated (ratio <0.05) and 55 up-regulated genes (ratio >20). P-values depicting significance of experimental values were calculated by Excel using a two-tailed test.
Whole genome expression profiling data of SOX10k.d. cells stored at NCBI GEO, accession number GSE37059 were processed via the R/Bioconductor environment using statistical analysis tools mentioned above. Affymetrix chip data were processed via package affy and normalized with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) from the same package. Package limma was used for making significance tests for differential gene expression. The results of these tests were adjusted for multiple testing via package q-value. Data were normalized with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA). Genes up-regulated (ratio >1.33) and down-regulated (ratio <0.75) with an average detection p-value <0.05 were analysed. Intersection sets were found via gene symbol annotations.
Quantile normalized expression data of CD271k.d. cells and shCtl. cells were analysed with the GSEA analyses tool of the Broad institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) and the molecular signature databases c2.all.v4.0.symbols.gmt (curated gene sets) and c3.all.v4.0.symbols.gmt (motif gene sets).
