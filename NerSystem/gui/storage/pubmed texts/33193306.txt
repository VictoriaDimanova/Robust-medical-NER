All experiments were performed with ethical approval by local authorities (Freiburg 239/1999 and 121/11 and Freiburg 66/13) according to the declaration of Helsinki. All patients and healthy donors (HD) had signed the informed consent.
In total 29 patients were included in the study at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Freiburg. 13 patients were diagnosed with RA, 8 with SLE, 2 with psoriatic arthritis, and 1 each with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), pSS, antisynthetase-syndrome, sarcoidosis, spondyloarthropathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient cohort included 7 male and 22 female individuals with a mean age of 61.4 years (SD: +/- 13.8 years). Patient and HD cohort were not matched for age and gender. Disease duration ranged from 2 to 56 years. C-reactive protein (CRP) of patients ranged from <3 to 25.5 mg/l, with one outlier of 96.2 mg/l. Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28) of patients with RA ranged from 1.8 to 4, including 10 patients in remission (DAS-28 < 2.6) and 2 patients with low disease activity (DAS-28 < 3.2). Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) of patients with SLE ranged from 0 to 4, with the exception of one patient with active disease (SLEDAI of 8). Treatment of patients included no more than 8.75 mg prednisolone/day. Some patients were currently treated with monoclonal antibodies against TNF- (n = 4) or IL-6R (n = 1). Other immunosuppressive therapies included methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate-mofetil. Patients characteristics and percentage of CD21low B cells are summarized in  Table 1 .

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from EDTA blood by Ficoll density centrifugation following standard protocols. Surface staining on T-B-co-cultures, fresh or frozen PBMCs was performed with optimal amounts of the respective antibodies at 4° C for 15 min. Sorting of B-cell subpopulations of patients and HD was performed on freshly isolated PBMCs within 4 h after blood withdrawal. As indicated in  Figure 1A  CD19pos B cells were divided into na¯ve (CD27negIgDpos), IgM memory (CD27posIgDpos), switched memory (CD27posIgDneg), and CD27negIgDneg memory B cells. CD21pos and CD21low subsets were distinguished from each of these subpopulations by subsequent gating on CD21lowCD38low and CD21posCD38dim B cells. B-cell sorting of four to six of the eight potential subpopulations within each sample was conducted with the MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter) or the Aria Cellsorter (BD). The sorted subsets were chosen according to the proportion of the respective populations. For information on sorted subpopulations please refer to  Supplementary Table 1 .
CD4 T cells were isolated from HD by negative selection using the Magnetic Cell-Sorting (MACS) CD4+ T-cell isolation kit of Miltenyi Biotec following the manufacturers instructions. The purity of isolated T cells was over 95% as determined by flow cytometry. For each experiment, B-cell subpopulations of one patient and one HD (B-cell HD) were matched with CD4 T cells of another HD (T-cell HD). DAPI was added before acquisition of data for exclusion of dead cells when necessary. To determine intracellular cytokines, T and B cells were co-cultured as described below. 10 µg/ml BFA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 6 h prior to harvest. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm and Perm/Wash Buffer (both BD Biosciences) following the manufacturers instructions, and samples were stained with the respective antibodies at optimal concentrations. Flow cytometric data was acquired at the LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences).
For T-B-cell co-cultures, 12,500 sorted B cells of patients and HD were cultivated either with or without 100 ng/ml of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) (Sigma-Aldrich) in IMDM (Life technologies GmbH) containing 10% FCS (Biochrom) and 100 U/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Life technologies GmbH). 18 h later allogenic CD4 T cells of a third-party T-cell HD (37,500 cells/well) were added and co-cultured for 24 h. After 24 h, supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis. As a positive control for activation, B cells were cultured with 2.5 µg/ml CpG alone for 42 h. Cells were washed and stained for flow cytometric analysis.
Cytokines were measured from the supernatants of co-cultures and SEB-stimulated T-cell cultures as described above. Measurements were conducted by a bead-based immunoassay (LEGENDplex¢ Multi-Analyte Flow Assay Kit, Human Th Cytokine Mix and Match Subpanel, BioLegend) according to manufacturers instructions and analyzed using the LSR Fortessa and the LEGENDplex software.
The data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Data were tested for normal distribution. For comparison of three groups, statistical differences were determined by parametric one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis testing (both unpaired) using Tukeys or Dunns post-hoc test for multiple comparison. In case of two groups, unpaired t-test was applied. Differences were considered statistically significant at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, or ****p < 0.0001. Data are shown as means with standard deviation (SD).
