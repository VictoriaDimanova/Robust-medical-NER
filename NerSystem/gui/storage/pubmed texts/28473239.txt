The SWS is a prospective study that assessed the diet, body composition, physical activity and social circumstances of a large group of non-pregnant women aged 2034 years in Southampton, UK. Comprehensive details have been published. Women who subsequently became pregnant were followed up during pregnancy with serial measurements of fetal size and their offspring studied in infancy and childhood. There were 1981 women who became pregnant and delivered a live-born singleton infant before the end of 2003. Six infants died in the neonatal period and two had major congenital growth abnormalities, which left 1973 mother-offspring pairs. Triceps skinfold thickness at birth and age 1-year was measured using Holtain skinfold calipers (Holtain Ltd., Crymych, UK). A sub-set of children from the SWS study with dietary data in infancy was invited to take part in follow-up at ages 4 and 6-years to assess their body composition (Table S2). Adiposity measurements were made by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Discovery, paediatric scan mode, Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA). Follow-up of the children and sample collection/analysis was carried out under Institutional Review Board approval (Southampton and SW Hampshire Research Ethics Committee 06/Q1702/104) with written informed consent. Clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
The GUSTO mother-offspring study collected biosamples and measured adiposity in babies born at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the centralized Institute Review Board (CIRB) and the Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB), the ethics boards of KKH and NUH, respectively (NCT01174875). 1247 women (response rate 61.3%) were recruited; participant characteristics are shown in Table S6. Infant weight was measured to the nearest gram on a calibrated scale (SECA 334, SECA Corp, Hamburg, Germany). Recumbent crownheel length was measured using an infant mobile measuring mat (SECA 210, SECA Corp Hamburg, Germany). At age 18 months ponderal index (weight/length) was derived as a measure of adiposity. Triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were measured using Holtain skinfold calipers.
The BIOCLAIMS study was a randomised controlled clinical trial of 100 volunteers recruited in Southampton UK 20122013. Inclusion criteria were: men or women aged 1865 years, BMI 18.525 (lean) or BMI 3040 kg/m2 with waist circumference > 94 cm for men > 80 cm for women (obese), not eating more than one oily fish meal per week and being able to provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: diagnosed diabetes, use of prescribed medicine to control inflammation, blood lipids or blood pressure, use of fish oil or other oil supplements, chronic gastrointestinal problems, pregnancy/planning pregnancy, or participation within another clinical trial. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 81 volunteers at baseline (lean n = 37, obese n = 44) (Table S12).
The Raine Study enrolled pregnant women  18th week of gestation (19891991) (N = 2900) through the antenatal clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital and nearby private clinics in Perth, Western Australia. Detailed clinical assessments were performed at birth. Birth information (including birth weight and height) was obtained from midwife records. The children were followed up at multiple time points including at 17 years of age at which time physical assessments including weight, height, and skin fold assessments were performed as described previously. Socioeconomic status was assessed by maternal education. Maternal weight and height was measured by a trained midwife at 18 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy weight was obtained at recruitment around 18 weeks gestation. Gestational age was based on the date of the last menstrual period unless there was discordance with ultrasound biometry at the dating scan. The Human Ethics Committees (King Edward Memorial Hospital and/or Princess Margaret Hospital) approved all protocols (RA/4/1/6613). Informed, written consent to participate in the study was obtained from the mother of each child at enrolment and at each subsequent follow-up.
A 510 cm segment was cut from the mid portion of each cord, immediately following delivery, flushed with saline to remove fetal blood, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 °C until required for DNA isolation. Genomic DNA was prepared from umbilical cord and cord blood by a standard high salt method, and from adipose tissue using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Genomic DNA from umbilical cord samples was obtained from 21 children from the SWS cohort, chosen to represent a range of %fat between the 5th and 95th percentiles for this population measured by DXA at age-6 years. DNA methylation levels were quantified using Agilent Human Promoter Whole-Genome ChIP-on-chip array (G4489A), and analysed using Bayesian Tool for Methylation Analysis (BATMAN) as previously described. An overview of the study design in shown in Fig. 1A.
Percentage methylation values at each 100 nt region were subjected to robust regression analysis percent fat to correct for heteroscedasticity. Fisher Exact tests were performed to identify larger chromosomal regions DMRs that tiled sequentially on the array. These regions were tested for significant enrichment of differential methylation amongst the 100 nt regions, within their span. This principal is similar to that of but is especially designed for the custom array design. The cut offs used to select DMRs were designed to be a stringent filter to prioritise genes for the pathway analysis.
It was observed that a portion of the probes included in the raw data had a log2 value approaching 0. These probes were assumed to be failed probes and were removed from the dataset and the modified dataset was subjected to the BATMAN algorithm. Any DMRs not robust between the two datasets were removed from consideration. A surrogate variable analysis (SVA) similar to the reference-free analysis suggested by was run to check for any confounding effects of differences in cellular heterogeneity.
Gene pathway analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen), with the design of the array set as the background in the pathway analysis. The gene list of identified DMRs from the BATMAN analysis was used to generate gene networks via a core analysis based upon the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base.
Statistical analysis on the SWS was carried out using Stata (Statacorp) versions 11.2 and 12.1. Histograms of all continuous variables were plotted to check for normality. The distributions of some measures of adiposity were skewed and therefore transformed using a loge transformation. Conditional sex-specific abdominal circumference growth velocities (Z-scores) were calculated from antenatal ultrasound measurements as described previously. Velocities of prenatal and infant growth were calculated from change in size adjusted for gestation or age, as appropriate. DXA adiposity measurements were calculated without including the child's head to minimise the effect of head movement on the measurement. Regression models were built using CpG methylation as the predictor and child's adiposity measurement (at 4 or 6 years) as the outcome, and of conditional abdominal circumstance growth velocity from 34 weeks gestation to birth as the predictor and cord CpG methylation as the outcome. Models were adjusted for child's sex and age as appropriate for each time point. Offspring adiposity was measured as %fat and total fat in grams, converted to Z-scores to facilitate interpretation of the effect size, and methylation measurements as %; the regression coefficient can therefore be interpreted as the standard deviation change in %fat (or total fat) for each % change in methylation. Results are presented as regression coefficients (), which represent the (mean) change in outcome for a one unit (%) change in methylation, and their associated p-values. Analyses for validation of the array results were carried out on the full range of data, without grouping.
As there was a strong correlation between methylation of the individual CpGs within ANRIL, and because the number of tests carried out was modest in comparison with genome-wide approaches, Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate corrections for multiple testing would not be appropriate. Instead a data reduction approach was employed by investigating the correlations between methylation at the 9 CpG sites, identifying those which cluster together statistically, and choosing the CpG with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) score to represent that cluster. In both the SWS and GUSTO cohorts, the clustering of CpGs sites was similar with CpGs 12, 3 48 clustering. The exception was CpG9, which clustered with CpG 48 in the SWS cohort but separately in the GUSTO cohort. We therefore used a clustering which was appropriate across both cohorts, and grouped the 9 CpG sites into 4 clusters CpGs 12, 3, 48 and 9, represented by CpGs 2, 3, 7 and 9.
Linear regression was used to analyse associations between DNA methylation levels, gene expression and infant adiposity measures in the GUSTO cohort. DNA methylation and infant adiposity measures were adjusted for sex, ethnicity, maternal age, mode of delivery and cell type. Cell type was corrected for using cellular proportions estimated from a reference panel's cell-specific methylation dataset. Experimental batches were accounted for as a covariate. Similar linear regressions were done to assess the relationship between methylation and gene expression. All statistical analyses in the GUSTO cohort were performed in R (version 2.15.3).
Linear regression was used to analyse association between DNA methylation levels and BMI in the Raine cohort. The distribution of BMI in this cohort was positively skewed and therefore log-transformed. Multivariate linear regression was adjusted for age and sex. Differences in cellular heterogeneity in blood was assessed Cell type.
The levels of DNA methylation at the CDKN2A DMR in DNA extracted from umbilical cord was measured by sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing as previously described. Methylation ranges are shown in Table S13 and primers in Table S14.
RNA was extracted from whole umbilical cords obtained in the GUSTO study, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA was prepared using the Hi-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies), and qPCR reactions run in triplicate with Power SYBR (Life Technologies) on a ABI 7900HT as per manufacturer's guidelines. Primer sequences are shown in Table S14 Primers to detect circular transcripts are described in. All Ct values were normalized to the geometric mean of TOP1 and PPIA reference amplicons, and thereafter referred to as dCt (delta-Ct) values. The dCt value was used in all subsequent regressions and statistical analyses, since assignment to a calibrator necessary for the exponential determination of fold change would be arbitrary and inappropriate for a longitudinal-type population with continuous characteristics.
Two sets of PCR primers were used. The first set amplified the ANRIL promoter ( 926 to + 20 relative to ANRIL TSS); a HindIII restriction site was added to the forward primer, and an NcoI restriction site to the reverse primer for cloning into pGL Basic (Promega, UK) to create pGL  951. The second PCR primer pair amplified a region containing the DMR, immediately adjacent to the already cloned ANRIL promoter region ( 1281 to  925); a KpnI restriction site was added to the forward primer, and a HindIII restriction site to the reverse primer for cloning into pGL  951. The completed plasmid, pGL ANRIL, contained the full genomic sequence from  1281 to + 20 of the ANRIL promoter with a HindIII site inserted after the DMR to allow its subsequent removal. All PCR amplification was carried out using Hot Star High Fidelity DNA polymerase (QIAGEN). Primers are listed in Table S14. The base pair sequence of the cloned region was confirmed by sequencing (GATC, Germany). The p14ARF promoter region was produced by GeneArt (Applied Biosystems), and subsequently cloned into pGL3 Basic.
Mutagenesis primers were designed using QuikChange Primer Design. PCR was carried out using the SequalPrep¢ Long PCR Kit (Life Technologies A10498) following manufacturers guidelines. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing (GATC, Germany).
SW872 cells were cultured in 24well plates (DMEM 4.5 g glucose, 10% FBS, 1%P/S) for 24 h prior to transfection. 500 ng plasmid DNA was transfected (six replicates per transfection). pGL CMV Renilla (Promega UK) was co-transfected as a control. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE HD (Switchgear Genomics USA) following manufacturers' guidelines. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h prior to harvesting. Luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega UK), on a VarioSkan Flash Luminometer (ThermoScientific). For estrogen treatment, cells were cultured in phenol-free media and charcol-stripped FBS for 48 h prior to addition of 10 nM E2 (Sigma E2758). Cells were cultured for 72 h then harvested for RNA.
RNA was extracted from whole umbilical cords obtained in the GUSTO study, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA was prepared using Enhanced AMV-RT (Sigma) after DnaseI treatment (Sigma). Realtime PCR was carried out in gene expression master mix (Life technologies), and gene expression assayed for p14 and exons 56 for ANRIL (Life technologies p14 (Hs99999189, Hs04259476). Anril unspliced used custom primers (Table S14) amplifying a region of intron 1.
EMSA were carried out on nuclear extracts from SW872 cells as previously described. DNA oligonucleotides (Sigma Aldrich) are listed in Table S14.
