Intraperitoneal macrophages were acquired from C57BL/6 mice as outlined in an animal use protocol approved by McGill University (Permit #2010-5860) according to Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. De-identified human peripheral blood was purchased from Research Blood Components (Boston, MA). Following informed written consent, blood was collected by venipuncture from healthy adult volunteers, recruited by Research Blood Components. Protocols for the collection of whole blood for research purposes were approved by New England Institutional Review Board.
THP-1 cells (TIB-202, ATCC) were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Wisent) with 10% FBS. SAEC cells were acquired following informed consent, permission, and ethical approval by Lonza, and were cultured in SAGM (Lonza), as directed by manufacturer. These cells were isolated by a proprietary method from the 1 mm bronchiole of the lung, which includes alveoli. H37Rv was cultured to mid-log phase in a rolling incubator at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 (Difco) with .05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC enrichment (BD Biosciences).
1106 THP-1 cells were terminally differentiated by 2108M PMA for 24 hours in RPMI with 10% charcoal stripped FBS, inducing cell cycle arrest. H37Rv cultures were centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in RPMI-1640 with 10% charcoal stripped FBS and .05% Tween-80 and clumping was disrupted by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle. Media was removed from THP-1 cells and replaced with media containing Mtb in the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 4 hours. THP-1 cells were then vigorously washed three times with RPMI to remove extracellular bacteria, followed by incubation in RPMI with 10% charcoal stripped FBS containing either vehicle (DMSO) or 1,25D at a final concentration of 107 M.
RNA extraction was performed with TRIzol/chloroform (Invitrogen) as per manufacturers' instructions. RT was performed with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and qPCR was performed with SsoFast Eva Green with low ROX (Bio-Rad) on an Eco qPCR cycler (Illumina), normalizing expression to -actin and 18S. Primers used are listed in Table S4. Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) were used to measure samples from two independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Microarray data presented is from one triplicate set, which is representative of the other.
Protein extracts from THP-1 cells were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and processed for Western blotting and separated on Tris-HEPES-SDS gradient protein gels (Pierce) using standard transfer and blotting protocols. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described in, using 2 µg of either rabbit serum IgG (sc-2027) or -caspase-1 p10 (sc-515, Santa Cruz) antibody for each sample.
Antibodies: -IL-1 (MAB601, R&D Systems), -AIM2 (ab93015, abcam), -caspase-1 p20 (sc-1780, Santa Cruz), -actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz), -VDR (sc-1008, Santa Cruz), -ASC (sc-271054, Santa Cruz), murine serum IgG (Sigma). Recombinant IL-1 was purchased from Millipore. ELISAs for DEFB4 (Abnova) and LL-37 (Hycult Biotech) were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
At the indicated time points, tissue culture plates were centrifuged to pellet any liberated mycobacteria and non-adherent cells. Media was aspirated and macrophages were lysed with water for 5 min, after which an equal volume of 2x 7H9 with .1% Tween-80 was added. Samples were vigorously resuspended and plated in serial dilution on Middlebrook 7H10 (Difco) with 10% OADC enrichment (BD Biosciences).
Following informed consent, blood was drawn from healthy adults. Buffy coats were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE Healthcare), and thrice resuspended in PBS and centrifuged to remove platelets. Monocytes were purified from the total leukocyte population by sorting of adherent cells after 2 hours, by washing the culture plates twice with RPMI-1640 with 20% human serum. Cells were allowed to differentiate into na¯ve macrophages over 6 days in RPMI-1640 with 20% human serum before infection, with media changes every two days throughout.
Intraperitoneal macrophages were elicited from C57BL/6 mice (Jackson) by intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate solution. Three days later, macrophages were collected by lavage of the peritoneal cavity. Macrophages were purified using CD11b Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) and allowed to adhere for 24 hours before infection.
One day after PMA-induced differentiation, siRNAs targeting CASP1, AIM2, IL1B, NLRP3, NOD2, and the non-targeting scrambled control (NC1) (Integrated DNA Technologies) were transfected into THP-1 cells using Transductin (Integrated DNA Technologies) in 10% Q-serum, according to manufacturer's instructions. After 4 hours, media was replaced with RPMI with 10% charcoal stripped FBS. After another 48 hours, cells were infected with H37Rv in accordance with the above protocol.
THP-1 cells were not infected or infected with H37Rv followed by treatment with DMSO or 1,25D at a final concentration of 107 M for 24 hours. Media was filter sterilized by passage through 0.20 µm filters. Media was then incubated with anti-IL-1 or non-specific murine IgG for 30 minutes before transfer to epithelial cell cultures. Cultures were harvested for RNA after 24 hours.
Epithelial cells were seeded in transwell buckets with 0.4 µm pores (Corning) and cultured in RPMI with 10% charcoal stripped FBS 48 hours before infection of the THP-1 cells. After the THP-1 cells were infected for 4 hours at a MOI of 5 and washed, SAECs were placed in co-culture with H37Rv-infected THP-1 cells by transferring the buckets containing the epithelial cells to the plates containing the infected macrophages, and then treated with DMSO or 1,25D (107 M). At indicated time points, plates were centrifuged and both cell populations were lysed with water and pooled for CFU assay, performed as described above.
Following 4% paraformaldehyde fixation over 10 minutes, cells on coverslips were washed with 100 mM glycine and then PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. Cells were incubated in PBS-0.2% BSA during 5 minutes. Primary antibody against LC3 (Novus Biological, dilution 1/300) was incubated with coverslips for 1 hour at 37°C in a humidified chamber in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% BSA. Following 3 washes, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit Alexa-647 (Life Technologies, dilution 1/1000) and with the anti-Mtb antibody coupled to FITC (Abcam ab20962, dilution 1/100) for 45 minutes at RT in the dark. Slides were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector) and observed with a Zeiss Axiovert X100 bright field microscope or a Zeiss LSM510 X100 confocal microscope. Images were acquired with LSM510 software. Stacks of confocal images, 3D reconstitution, and quantification of percent of colocalization were performed with Imaris 7.4 and the figures were assembled with Photoshop (Adobe).
Total caspase-1 activity was assayed using ICE/Caspase-1 Colorimetric Protease Assay Kit (Millipore) as per manufacturers' instructions. Cell lysates were incubated with YVAD-pNA and read in a spectrophotometer at 405 nM.
Media from THP-1 cells was collected 24 hours after treatment and sterilized by passage through .20 µm filters. Levels of secreted cytokines and chemokines were assayed by Milliplex Human Cytokine Panels 1, 2 and 3 (Millipore) and read on a BioPlex (Bio-Rad).
Infected and uninfected THP-1 cells were collected after 24 hours of treatment. Cells were fixed for 20 minutes with 1% formaldehyde, and washed with 1.25 µM glycine. Following cell and nuclei lysis, chromatin was sonicated for 75 cycles of 10 s ON/20 s OFF on a Bioruptor Sonicator (Diagenode). IPs were then performed with either normal rabbit IgG, 6 µg of anti-VDR (Santa Cruz sc13133) or 6 µg of anti-RNA Polymerase II (Abcam anti-polIICTD #ab5131). Primers used for region amplification are listed in Table S4. Quantification of immunoprecipitated material was performed by qPCR and normalized for input DNA.
Student's t-test, ANOVA, or a two-tailed Fisher's exact test was performed where indicated using GraphPad software. For microarray samples, Flexarray v1.6 software was used to normalize overall chip signal using the Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) algorithm. The EB (Wright and Simon) algorithm was used for statistical analysis to calculate fold transcript expression and significance between of each experimental condition relative to the uninfected, untreated condition (NI).
Cell-free media supernatant was collected from infected macrophages with and without SAECs in co-culture. Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH) from Roche was used in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
