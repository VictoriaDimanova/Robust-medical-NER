The human osteosarcoma cell line KHOS and the drugresistant osteosarcoma cell line KHOSMR were kindly provided by Dr. Efstathios Gonos (Institute of Biological Research & Biotechnology, Athens, Greece) (Lourda et al., 2007). The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS was purchased from the ATCC, and its drugresistant cell line U2OSMR was generated as previously reported (Yang et al., 2009a,b). The human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 and the paclitaxelresistant variant SKOV3TR, the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the paclitaxelresistant variant MCF7TR have been described previously (Duan et al., 2005, 2008). These osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer and breast cancer drugresistant cell lines have been characterized with the stable MDR phenotype in previous studies. All of the cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U·mL1 penicillin and 100 g·mL1 streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere, with 5% CO295% air and passaged twice every 23 days.
Frozen tissue samples from 49 patients who had undergone surgical resection of osteosarcoma were obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sarcoma tissue bank and were studied according to the policies of the institutional review board of the hospital. This study was conducted with the approval of the MGH Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol #:2007P002464/5). All specimens were assessed by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
Total miRs were extracted from cancer cell lines using the miRNANeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) by following the manufacturer's instructions. A similar protocol was used to isolate miRs from the osteosarcoma frozen tissues. The purity and quantity of the isolated small miRs were assessed based on the quality of total RNA using 1% formaldehydeagarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometer measurement (Beckman, Columbia, MD, USA). The miR samples were submitted to LC Sciences (Houston, TX, USA) for further analysis by Agilent Bioanalyzer. The miR microarray assay was performed using a service provider (LC Sciences). The assay started from a 5g total RNA sample, which was sizefractionated using a YM100 Microcon centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and the small RNAs (< 300 nucleotides) isolated were 3extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated to the poly(A) tail for later fluorescent dye staining; two different tags were used for the two RNA samples in dualsample experiments. Hybridization was performed overnight on a Paraflo microfluidic chip (miRHuman_16.0) using a microcirculation pump (Atactic Technologies, Houston, TX, USA). On the microfluidic chip, each detection probe consisted of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target miR (from miRNABase, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/) or other RNA (control sequences). The hybridization melting temperatures were balanced by chemical modifications of the detection probes. Hybridization used 100 L 6 SSPE buffer (0.90 m NaCl, 60 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) containing 25% formamide at 34 °C. After RNA hybridization, tagconjugating Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were circulated through the microfluidic chip for dye staining. Fluorescence images were collected using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and digitized using arraypro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).
Multiplesample analysis involves normalization, data adjustment, ttest and clustering. Normalization was carried out using a cyclic LOWESS (locally weighted regression) method. The normalization removed systemrelated variations, such as sample amount variations, different labelling dyes and signal gain differences of scanners so that biological variations could be accurately detected. Intensity values were log2transformed for further analysis. Gene centring and normalization transformed the log2 values using the mean and the SD of individual genes across all samples using the following formula: Value = [(Value)  Mean (Gene)]/[SD (Gene)]. For hierarchical cluster analysis, the clustering was performed using a hierarchical method and with an average linkage and Euclidean distance metric. All data processes, except the clustering plot, were carried out using inhouse (LC Sciences)developed computer programs. The clustering plot was generated using tigr mev (Multiple Experimental Viewer) software from The Institute for Genomic Research. For statistical analysis of microarray data, a ttest was performed between the control and test sample groups. tvalues were calculated for each miR, and Pvalues were computed from the theoretical tdistribution. miRs with Pvalues below a critical Pvalue (typically 0.01) were selected for cluster analysis.
Realtime reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) was performed to validate differentially expressed miRs in osteosarcoma cell lines. Expressions of miR15b were determined in osteosarcoma tissues. For mature miR detection, cDNA reverse transcription was performed from total RNA samples using specific miR primers from the TaqMan miR Assay and reagents from the TaqMan miR Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using TaqMan miR Assay primers with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and analysed with a StepOnePlus RealTime PCR System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of RNU48 miR was used as an endogenous control. The relative levels of miR15b expression were calculated from the relevant signals by normalization with the signal for RNU48 miR expression. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relationships between miR15b expression levels and clinical features of patients with osteosarcoma were analysed by chisquare test and Student's ttest. The miR15b expression levels were divided by the median value. The highexpression group (> 600) was set above the median value, and the lowexpression group ( 600) was set below the median value. Overall survival curves were analysed with the KaplanMeier method and compared using the logrank test. A statistically significant difference was defined as Pvalue less than 0.05.
To determine potential miR15b copy number variation between chemoresistance and their parental sensitive cell lines, the TaqMan Copy Number Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 ng of genomic DNA was prepared in a final volume of 20 L containing Reference Assay human RNase P (VIC dyelabelled TAMRA¢ probe) and Custom Assay miR15b (FAM¢ dyelabelled NFQMGB probe; probe: 5CTACAGTCAAGATGCGAATCAT3; FWD: 5CTGTAGCAGCACATCATGGTTTAC3; REV: 5GAATGAATTTCCTTAAATTTCTAGAGCAGCAA3). The absolute quantification method was used to determine CT data from the duplex PCR run on the StepOnePlus RealTime PCR System. The reaction was run as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Afterwards, results were analysed on copycaller ¢ Software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems) with Manual CT threshold: 0.2; Autobaseline: On; and Predicted Copy Number: 2. Experiments were carried out with four replicates. Data were presented as copy number  SD.
The human osteosarcoma KHOSMR and U2OSMR MDR cells were transfected with Lipofectamine¢ RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) and premiR15 precursor (hsamiR15b, Ambion PremiR¢ miR Precursor; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) or nonspecific control miR precursor according to the manufacturer's instructions. These miR15b precursor molecules (readytouse miR mimics) are small, chemically modified doublestranded RNA molecules designed to mimic endogenous mature miR15b. They enable detailed study of miR15b biological effects via gainoffunction experiments. The sequence of the mature miR for premiR15b was 5UAGCAGCACAUCAUGGUUUACA3.
Wee1 knockdown in osteosarcoma cells was performed by transfection with synthetic human Wee1 siRNA (GenBank Accession Number NM_003390, 5CATGTAACAAGGATCTCCA3) purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides were used as negative control. The siRNA oligonucleotides were dissolved in nucleasefree water at a concentration of 100 mmol·L1 and kept at 20 °C until the following transfection experiment. The effects of Wee1 siRNA on cellular growth and proliferation were assessed in vitro using the MTT assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Drug sensitivity was determined using a 3(4,5dimethylthiazol2yl)2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; SigmaAldrich) assay. To evaluate the reversal of drug resistance by miR, briefly, osteosarcoma KHOSMR and U2OSMR MDR cells were transfected with miR15b precursor as described above and plated in a 96well plate. Doxorubicin was added in appropriate concentrations 24 h later. An equivalent amount of diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to culture medium as a negative control. After 96 h of drug incubation, 20 L of MTT (20 mg·mL1) was added to each well. After incubation for an additional 4 h, 200 L of isopropanolHCl solution was added to each well to dissolve the intracellular formazan crystal products. Absorbance was determined using a 96well SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 560 and 650 nm (background). Drugs at the concentrations utilized in the MTT assay were performed in the absence of cells to verify no change in absorbance. Response curves were fitted using graphpad prism 4 software (GraphPad PRISM Software; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Total protein from osteosarcoma cell lines was extracted by 1 RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA, USA). Protein concentration was determined by the DC Protein Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by NuPAGE 412% BisTris Gel (Life Technologies), transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany) and incubated with Wee1specific primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Cat# sc5285, Dallas, TX, USA, dilution 1 : 1000) and actin (SigmaAldrich, dilution 1 : 2000) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were further probed with respective secondary antibodies (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) and scanned by Odyssey CLx imaging equipment (LICOR Biosciences) to detect the bands and the density. Densitometric analysis of western blot results was performed with ImageJ as described in the software's user guide. The relative expression of Wee1 was normalized with respect to actin expression. The western blot was performed in triplicate.
For luciferase (Luc) activity analysis, osteosarcoma KHOSMR and U2OSMR MDR cells were seeded in 96well plates, and 100 ng of LucWee13UTR reporter vector (SwitchGear Genomics, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and 40 nm of miR15 precursor or 40 nm of nonspecific miR precursor control vectors were cotransfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection by the LightSwitch Luciferase Assay Reagent¢ (SwitchGear Genomics).
To determine the effect of restoring miR15 expression on reversing drug resistance in osteosarcoma in vivo, approximately 2  106 human osteosarcoma KHOSMR MDR cells were resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) in a 1 : 1 volume ratio and injected subcutaneously into the right hind flanks of 4 to 6weekold Crl:SHOPrkdc SCID Hr hr nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Two weeks after injection, when the average tumour volume reached ~ 100 mm3, the mice were randomized into three groups (N = 10 per group). Group 1 received injections with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl), group 2 with 2 mg·kg1 doxorubicin and group 3 with the combination of in vivoready mirVana¢ miR15b mimics (Life Technologies) and doxorubicin (obtained from residual clinical materials provided by the pharmacy at the Massachusetts General Hospital). These in vivoready miR mimics are nontoxic and did not induce an immune response in the animal models tested. miR15b mimics were injected via tail vein with Invivofectamine 2.0 Reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Doxorubicin was injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 2 mg·kg1 animal body weight. Two weeks after injection of KHOSMR MDR cells, when the average tumour volume reached ~ 100 mm3, saline, doxorubicin alone or doxorubicin in combination with in vivoready mirVana¢ miR15b mimics was administered twice per week four times. For validation, we also included a group of mice with osteosarcoma KHOSMR MDR cells previously transfected with miR15b precursor, established before subcutaneous injection. Effects on tumour growth rate were assessed in each mouse by determining the tumour volume on the day of treatment relative to the tumour volume on day 0. Tumour volume (mm3) was determined by digital calliper measurements and calculated as W2  L/2, where W is width and L is length. Data are presented as mean  SD. Animals were killed, once morbidity became evident or their tumour size exceeded 800 mm3. Following the indicated treatments, tumour tissues from the above treated animals were collected and placed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. The effects of the miR15b mimic treatment on Wee1 expression were determined by immunohistochemical staining as described above. All animal studies were in compliance with the protocol approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (SRAC) under the protocol number 2009N000229.
The osteosarcoma tissue microarray (TMA) has been described previously and contains 114 tumour tissues. The expression levels of Wee1 were determined following the immunohistochemistry protocol as previously reported (Ryu et al., 2010). A similar immunohistochemistry protocol was also used to determine Wee1 expression in osteosarcoma tissues from the mouse xenograft model. Wee1positive samples were defined as those showing nuclear staining pattern in the tumour tissues. Wee1 staining patterns were categorized into six groups: 0, no nuclear staining; 1+, < 10% of cells nuclearstained positive; 2+, 1025% positive cells; 3+, 2650% positive cells; 4+, 5175% positive cells; 5+, > 75% positive cells. The percentage of cells showing positive nuclear staining for Wee1 was calculated by reviewing the entire spot. Categorization of Wee1 staining was completed by two independent investigators. Discrepant scores between the two investigators were rescored to obtain a single final score.
KaplanMeier survival analysis (GraphPad PRISM) was used to analyse the correlation between the level of Wee1 expression and prognosis. Student's ttest was used to compare the differences between groups. Results are given as mean  SD, and values with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
