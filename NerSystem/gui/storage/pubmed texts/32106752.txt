CHO-PDL1-CD3L and Jurkat-PD-1-NFAT cell lines were obtained from National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (China), cultured in DMEM/F12 (11330032, Gibco) or RPMI-1640 (11875093, Gibco) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% NEAA (11140050, Gibco) and 100 g/mL penicillin-streptomycin (SV30010, Hyclone), and selected with hygromycin B (400052, Merck Millipore) and puromycin (P8230, Solarbio), respectively. HCC827 and MC38 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco).
To prepare the mAbs, Balb/C mice (Charles River) were immunized with recombinant human PD-1 protein (produced in house). Splenocyte-derived hybridomas producing mAbs reactive to PD-1 were screened by ELISA. The generation and humanization of the murine mAb was performed as described previously. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells producing the anti-PD-1 mAbs. Variable region genes of the antibody were obtained by degenerate polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the mouse IgG light chain and heavy chain constant regions. After activity validation of the recombinant antibody, the humanized antibody was constructed by 1) using a human IgG4 format containing an S228P (Ser228 to Pro228) mutation to prevent the IgG4 arm exchange, and 2) replacing the murine framework region with a human counterpart. Activity was tested after every modification. The S254T/V308P/N434A (TPA) variants were produced using the method of QuikChange and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary stable cell line and purified with protein G affinity chromatography.
The potency of HX008 to block the PD-1 engagement of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was evaluated in a competitive ELISA. PD-1-hFc protein (PD-1 protein with human IgG1Fc, Akesobio) was incubated in 96-well plates at 4°C overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of HX008 and nivolumab protein (4.12 ~ 3000 ng/mL, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Lot. AAE6383) were applied to duplicate wells in the presence of 0.3 g/mL PD-L1-mFc (containing a mouse IgG2aFc). After one-hour incubation, the bound competitive ligands were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. 115-035-062) and developed with 3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Biosharp, Cat. Amresco0759) substrates. The IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of antibodies was determined by fitting the absorbance-concentration data to a four-parameter regression model. PD-L2 inhibition ELISA was performed in the same set-up with higher ligand concentration (1 g/mL PD-L2).
Binding kinetics of the HX008 to FcRIIIa and Clq were tested using Octet system based on BLI technology. In the binding assay of FcRIIIa, 1 g/mL biotin-labeled FcRIIIa (produced in house) was immobilized on streptavidin-coated biosensor for 300 s to reach a saturation level. HX008 was added with serial concentrations initiating from 125 nM and contacted for 120 s, followed by 180 s dissociation. Binding kinetics to C1q were determined by coating 100 g/mL HX008 on an anti-human Fab-CH1 2nd Generation (FAB2G) Biosensor for 300 s. The captured antibodies were then detected by loading C1q protein (fitzgerald, Cat. 32R-AC049) of serial dilutions ranging from 3.13 to 200 nM, allowing the proteins to associate for 120 s and dissociate for 180 s. All BLI experiments were performed on the Octet instrument (ForteBio, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, and all kinetics data were collected and analyzed using ForteBio Data Analysis 7.0 software.
The MLR assays were used to evaluate and compare the capacity of HX008 and nivolumab to stimulate the release of IL-2 and IFN by T lymphocytes, details being described as follows. PBMC were isolated from fresh blood samples of healthy donors using ficoll density gradient separation. All blood samples were taken after the donors provided written informed consent for the donation. After a 4-h incubation at 37°C, adherent cells were cultured in supplemented RPMI medium containing 10% FBS together with human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (peprotech, Cat. 30003) and IL-4 (peprotech, Cat. 20004) to obtain immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Maturation of iDCs was accomplished with tumor necrosis factor (peprotech, Cat. 300-01A) stimulation. Then, the mature DCs were co-cultured with allogeneic T cells from another healthy donor in the presence of a titration of antibodies. After incubating for 5 days, the secretion levels of IL-2 and IFN in the cell supernatant were determined using commercially available ELISA kits in accordance with the manufacturers instructions (Dakewe).
The ability of HX008 to improve T-cell functions via inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling was determined using two engineered cell lines: 1) CHO-PDL1-CD3L expressing PD-L1 and anti-CD3 single-chain antibody fragment, and 2) Jurkat-PD-1-NFAT expressing PD-1 and the luciferase gene under the control of the NFAT response elements. The experiments were carried out as described previously. CHO-PD-L1-CD3L cells were seeded in 96-well plate and cultured for 16  2 h prior to the addition of serially diluted HX008 and nivolumab. Then, the cultures were mixed with Jurkat-PD-1-NFAT cells at a ratio of 1:2 and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 h. The relative luciferase intensity was revealed with luminescent substrate and detected by EnVision multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The data were analyzed with a four-parameter regression model.
In vivo studies in mice were contracted to Crown Bioscience Inc., and the PK study in cynomolgus monkeys was contracted to WestChina-Frontier PharmaTech Co. Ltd. All animal experiments in this study were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Medical Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Health, Peoples Republic of China), and were approved and overseen by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
An adoptive transfer of human PBMCs into NSG mice (Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University) following tumor cells inoculation was used to establish a MiXeno model and investigate the antitumor effect of HX008 in HCC827 (human non-small cell lung cancer). 5  106 HCC827 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of 40 NSG mice (32 mice plus 8 in surplus) on Day 0. When the mean tumor volume reached 66 mm3 after 6 days of tumor cell inoculation (Day 6), 32 mice were evenly divided into 4 groups according to the tumor volume. Then, PBMCs re-suspended in PBS were injected into the tail vein of NSG mice. Mice of groups 1 ~ 4 were given i.v. administration of HX008 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (test group), nivolumab 5 mg/kg (positive group, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) and isotype antibody human IgG4 5mg/kg (control group, produced by Crown Bioscience (Taicang) Inc), and each dose was administered on Day 6, 9, 13, 16, 19 and 22 after inoculation, six administrations in total. Efficacy and safety were evaluated according to the tumor growth inhibition value based on relative tumor volume (TGIRTV), animal body weight changes and death rate.
The HuGEMM model (Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University) developed by replacing the extracellular region of C57BL/6 mouse PD-1 gene with a human counterpart enabled us to test the antitumor activity of HX008 directly on mouse MC38 tumor. MC38 cells were subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank of the tested mice (1  106 cells/mouse). When the average tumor volume reached about 134 mm3, mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups according to the tumor volume (8 mice per group). Mice of four groups received tail i.v. administration of HX008 (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, test groups), pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg, positive control group, Merck) and isotype antibody human IgG4 (5 mg/kg, negative control group, produced by Crown Bioscience (Taicang) Inc) twice weekly for a total of 6 doses. Efficacy and safety evaluation were accomplished based on tumor growth inhibition value-based TGIRTV, animal body weight changes, and death rate.
In a single-dose PK study, 24 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were randomly divided into four groups according to body weight: a high dose group of nivolumab (10 mg/kg), and low, middle, and high dose group of HX008 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg). Each group has six monkeys (three males and three females per group) and received a single i.v. administration. The whole blood was collected and processed for serum pre-dose, and at 5, 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 144, 216 h post-dose. Concentrations of nivolumab and HX008 in cynomolgus monkey serum were determined with standard curve plotted by ELISA, and related PK parameters were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin (Pharsight) 6.4.
The concentration of HX008 in the serum of cynomolgus monkeys was tested via ELISA. PD1-mFc was coated on the plate overnight followed by washing and antibody incubation. Then, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG was added and detection signals were produced by TMB substrate. Finally, the reaction was stopped by sulfuric acid and detected at 450 nm. The color density of reaction is associated with HX008 concentration. Repeatability, precision, and accuracy had been validated for the method.
Anti-HX008 antibodies in the serum of cynomolgus monkeys are tested with Bridging-ELISA method. HX008 should be coated on the plate first. Positive controls (rabbit polyclonal anti-HX008 antibodies, HanX Biopharmaceuticals, produced in house) were added, followed by incubation with biotin-labeled HX008 (HX008-Biotin). Captured HX008-biotin was then detected by HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Reaction was revealed by TMB, stopped with 0.5 M H2SO4, and read at wavelength of 450 nm. Absorbance is proportional to concentrations of positive control samples or ADA in study samples.
This study was an open-label, single-arm Phase 1a clinical trial (CTR20180125) conducted in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. The study was designed to investigate the safety and tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of HX008 monotherapy. HX008 was administered as a 60-min i.v. infusion at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg or a fixed dose of 200 mg/patient every 3 weeks, with a 6, 8, 6, 10-patient cohort, respectively. Serum samples were collected at 1 h pre-administration and 0, 2, 8, 24, 72, 168, 366 h post-administration and the single-dose PK was evaluated on Day 21 after administration.
The concentration of HX008 in human serum sample is tested using the Bridging-ECLIA (Electrochemiluminescent Immunoassay) method of MSD. Biotinylated PD-1-his was captured on the MSD SA plate. Then test samples, standard, and quality control were added into the plate. After washing excess antibodies, sulfo-tag-conjugated goat anti-human IgG4 antibody were added to form the complex of biotin-PD-1  HX008  Sulfo-Tag-Mouse anti-human IgG4 antibody. Finally, the reaction was developed by MSD Read Buffer and read on MSD instruments. The results were processed by fitting the data to a five-parameter model, the weight coefficient of which is 1/Y2.
The analytical method for detecting ADA in human blood sample is based on the Bridging-ECLIA method of MSD. The assay is briefly described as follows. The working solution of capture reagent (biotinylated drug), detection reagent (sulfo-tag conjugated drug), and neutralizing reagent was added to the polypropylene plate, and then the test sample, verification sample or internal control after acidolysis were added to the plate. After a complete reaction in the dark with shaking, the sample mixture was transferred to a blocked MSD Streptavidin Gold Plate. The Drug-ADA-Drug complex bound to the MSD SA Plate after incubation in dark with shaking. Finally, the reaction was developed by MSD Read Buffer T and read on the MESO QUICKPLEX SQ120. The signal value was directly proportional to the concentration of ADA. The highest tolerance of drug for the method can reach up to 200.0 µg/mL, 50.0 µg/mL, and 20.0 µg/mL under the conditions of 1000 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL ADA (molar ratio is about 1: 200, 1: 250, 1: 200), respectively.
The human clinical study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and the study protocol and all amendments were approved by the institutional ethics committees. Each patient provided written informed consent.
The potency of activity assay is expressed as the ratio of EC50. A four-parameter model was used to fit a doseresponse curve, through which the EC50 of drugs was determined. All error bars represent the mean  SD or SEM as indicated. In vitro assays were performed in triplicate. For the in vivo assays, the significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with the Dunn-Sidak post hoc test. The value for which P < .05, 0.01 or 0.001 was considered statistically significant, and was marked by one to three asterisks, respectively.
