We extended a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Clinical Trial number: NCT02195726). Briefly, 30 UA and NSTEMI patients were recruited from the Cardiology Department of the University of Turin from January 2019 through September 2019.
UA/NSTEMI, age >40 and <85 were the inclusion criteria, while Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min, previous or active cancer, body mass index (BMI) >29 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, critical stenosis of the lower limbs and carotids and STEMI were the exclusion criteria. All procedures were in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and all participants provided written informed consent.
The RIPC protocol consisted of four 5 min cycles of manual blood pressure cuff inflation to 200 mmHg (or 50 mmHg over the baseline if systolic blood pressure was >150 mmHg) around the non-dominant arm, and this was alternated with 5 min deflations. Sham procedure was performed by inflating the cuff to 20 mmHg alternated with 5 min deflation. Based on other studies, EVs were collected from either radial or femoral artery blood samples after PCI (Figure 1). All data are reported as median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) SEM.
Patients included in the study were randomized to a different protocol, sham or RIPC (n = 15/group). After PCI procedure, three (7 mL) arterial blood samples from each patient were collected (Figure 1).
After blood collection, the serum samples underwent the precipitation procedure for EV isolation. The protamine (P) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)/Polyethylene glycol (PEG 35,000; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) precipitation solution (P/PEG; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (0.2 g PEG 35,000 and 1 mg protamine chloride/mL; 1:4) was added to the samples.
After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min at 22 °C and the pellet was re-suspended in sterile saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) and subjected to microfiltration with 0.22 m filters (MF-Millipore) to remove larger vesicles. 
After isolation, different approaches were exploited for EV characterization. Firstly, EVs were counted and analyzed using a NanoSight NS300 equipped with Nanosight Tracking Analyses Analytical Software (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). For each sample, the number and size of EVs were evaluated. EV flow cytometry analysis was performed, 10126, Turin, Italy using the MACSPlex Exosome Kit (human, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), following the manufacturers protocol. Therefore, each sample was analyzed using a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). CytExpert Software 1.0 (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to analyze flow cytometric data. Moreover, EV FACS analyses were performed using GUAVA (Guava easyCyte Flow Cytometer, Millipore, Germany). EVs were detected using flow cytometry beads (Aldehyde/Sulfate latex 4% w/v 4µm, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and PE- and FITC-conjugated antibodies directed to CD11b, CD14, CD62p, CD144, Caveolin and Troponin (Dako Denmark A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). FITC and PE mouse non-immune Isotypic IgG (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) served as controls. EVs were incubated with each antibody or isotype control antibody at 4°C in 100L PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then analyzed.
TEM was performed on EVs, which were resuspended in PBS, placed on 200-mesh nickel formvar carbon-coated grids (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA) and left to adhere for 20 min. The grids were incubated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing 2% sucrose, and, after washing in distilled water, EVs were processed as previously described and observed with a Jeol JEM 1010 electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan).
H9c2 and HMEC-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). HMEC-1 cells were grown in MCDB131 (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor, 1 g/mL of hydrocortisone, 2 mM glutamine and 1% (v/v) streptomycin/penicillin) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. H9c2 were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium nutrient mixture DMEM-F12 (supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% (v/v) streptomycin/penicillin). 
In order to verify the EVs effect on cardiomyocytes (H9c2) subjected to H/R, cells were serum-starved (in FBS 2% depleted of EVs) for 24 h. H9c2 were pre-treated with EVs (1  104 EV/cell) for 2 h and then subjected to 2 h of hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2) in the presence of EVs. Subsequently, reoxygenation was performed (21% O2 and 5% CO2) for 1 h. The same protocol was applied for the co-culture experiments.
At the end of the H/R protocol, cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) kit as indicated by the manufacturers. In brief, after 2 h incubation at 37 °C, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added. The plates were read at 570 nm to obtain the optical density values.
Male Wistar rats (4 months old, body weight 350400 g, Envigo Laboratories Udine, Italy) were used for the ex vivo experiments. Rats received humane care in compliance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The local Animal Use and Care Committee approved the animal protocol (protocol no: E669.N.OVL). Animals were housed under controlled conditions with free access to tap water and to standard rat diet.
Rats were anesthetized (Zoletil 100 mg/Kg and Xylazine 15 mg/Kg) and heparinized (800 U/100 g b.w., i.m.) and hearts were rapidly excised, placed in an ice-cold buffer solution and weighed. Isolated rat hearts were retrograde perfused with oxygenated KrebsHenseleit buffer solution (KHS; mM, 127 NaCl, 5.1 KCl, 17.7 NaHCO3, 1.26 MgCl4, 1.5 CaCl2, 11 D-glucose, pH 7.4) through a cannula inserted into the ascending aorta. Hearts kept in a temperature-controlled chamber (37 °C) were perfused in constant-flow mode. 
SHAM group (n = 3) served as non-ischemic hearts (2 h);
I/R group (n = 5): hearts were subjected to I/R protocol;
EV-naive (n = 15): hearts were pre-treated with EV-naive (1  109/mL) for 10 min before I/R protocol;
EV-RIPC (n = 15): hearts were pre-treated with EV-RIPC (1  109/mL) for 10 min before I/R protocol.
The protocols carried out on the isolated hearts were as follows:
For the infarct size analysis, the hearts were allocated on the Langendorff apparatus. The hearts underwent I/R protocol and were contextually treated or untreated as above indicated. The infarct size assessment was performed using ImageJ software on heart slices dyed with 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). At the end of each experiment, the hearts were detached from the Langendorff apparatus and the left ventricles were frozen for 2 h. After freezing, the hearts were dissected into 45 slices of 23 mm that were incubated in pre-warmed TTC stain (10 mg/mL in phosphate buffer) at 37 °C for 5 min. The ImageJ analysis program was used to calculate, slice by slice, the infarct size for each heart.
Based on our previous study, to investigate the EV mechanism of action, EV mRNA content was analyzed by using a specific Cardiovascular Disease PCR Array. To this end, six samples (3/group), were retro-transcribed with the RT2First Strand Kit, and gene expression was analyzed using the PAHS 174Z RT2 ProfilerTM Human Cardiovascular Disease PCR Array (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers protocol. The analysis was performed using GeneGlobe QIAGEN online software. Fold regulation EV-naive sample expressions with respect to the EV-RIPC group were calculated for all samples using the Ct method. The p values were obtained based on a Students t-test of the replicate 2(-Delta CT) values for each gene in the control group and treatment groups, and p values less than 0.05 are indicated. Parametric, unpaired, two-sample equal variance and two-tailed distributions were used to calculate the p values. Predicted functional interaction network was analyzed using STRING software. Network analysis provided information on the molecular and cellular interactions of genes/proteins within the network.
The canonical cardio-protective pathways were evaluated by analyzing the expression level of the phosphorylated STAT-3 for the SAFE pathway and the phosphorylated Erk-1/2 for the RISK cascade. To this end, the hearts (LV apexes) were lysed in RIPA buffer with proteinase inhibitors. Samples were quantified by the Bradford method (50 g protein per sample was loaded) and equal amounts of total protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-p-tyr705 STAT-3, anti-p-Erk-1/2 (#9131 and #9102, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Bcl-2, anti-Vinculin (05-386 Merck/Millipore, St. Louis, MO, USA) and anti-DUSP6 (ab76310 Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies were used as primary antibodies, followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were detected with Clarity Western ECL substrate (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and quantified by densitometry using analytic software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Results were normalized with respect to densitometric value of anti-vinculin antibody. EVs were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 30 g protein per sample was loaded for Western blot. Anti-CD63, anti-CD81 (ab134045, ab109201, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-CD29 (Ma5-17103, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and anti-GM130 (ab52649, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies served as exosomal markers and negative markers of EV, respectively.
All data from the in vitro and ex vivo experiments are reported as means  SEM. Comparisons between two groups were carried out using the MannWhitney test or the paired t-test, while comparisons between ¥3 groups were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys multiple comparison test. Our data passed normality and equal variance tests. The cut-off for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. In vitro and ex vivo results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. All statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism version 8.2.1 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
